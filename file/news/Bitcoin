Title: Looking for options to buy a house outright while liquidating the least amount of bitcoin possible.
9
Congratulations on your ROI. Well done..If I were you,  I would not liquidate your IRA's to complete the house purchase. Taking the penalty is just throwing money away, and a tiny bit of diversification is always a good idea, IMO..At the end of the day, it will make the difference between being left with 55 btc vs. 60, not really an earth-shattering difference..But this would just be my preference. Everyone is different
2
I admire you! 90 BTC, wtf...
1
First congrats...If i were you i would move to a low-med COL area if possible and buy a modest home around 500k with a mortage and not with a lump sum.Most people buy more house (sqft wise) than they actually need and that costs them a lot of money in interest ...Sell a tiny bit of btc from your stack for the down payment and keep the rest in cold storage for a decade at least.
1
I would just wait and relax for next year, chances are we see prices of 120k-150k in the bullrun , then you would sell 20-25 bitcoin for a 3M house and still have left about 65-70 bitcoin...That would be my plan with such an amount of bitcoin. And the remaining 60-70 bitcoin would be really enough to retire early in the upcoming years...  .and gz for the amount you hold, its awesome, and it was a nice idea in 2017 to buy bitcoin.
1
Honestly, I wouldn’t sell if I were you. There will be ways to loan against bitcoin, and you have a chance to keep the asset while being able to use leverage to pay off the house you get...I can tell you that if your purpose for buying a house is solely for living necessity and not so much as an asset, then it I can understand and agree with your sentiments, especially if you have two children and looking for a house to pass down for future generations. However, if your purpose for buying a house is because you’re getting FOMO because you’re scared prices are going higher, or you believe it’s a viable store of value, I don’t think that’s a very good financial decision...Either way, just understand that Bitcoin is basically designed so that values of houses, dwellings, equity in companies, and pretty much every other asset on earth will revert back to its conventional intended use value. Keep fighting the good fight! Best of luck OP!

Title: Two Monthly Buys or Daily Purchases?
1
Daily purchases might reduce the risk of market timing, spread out your investment, and can lead to better long-term returns by mitigating the impact of volatility.
2
Bi-monthly or just do one on the first of each month. If you pull back and look at a 10-year price chart, it's not gonna make much of a difference. Also, wouldn't a daily purchase be a tax record nightmare?
1
Buy once or twice a month. If you buy daily, future transaction fees will be significantly higher.
1
DCA every day on Strike and you don't pay any fees after the first week. This is what I do, that way you get a nice average price.
1
Nonsense...You buy on an exchange, those are not onchain transactions ..You just don't transfer to cold storage too often, as that would create a lot of UXTO's which is probably what you are referring to.
1
True for everybody that is dumb enough to leave their BTC on an exchange. Every buy I make goes directly to cold storage, therefor UXTO is definitly something to keep in mind.
1
You are recommending to not DCA daily because of UXTO's so once again, that is nonsense.

Title: Will Bitcoin long run just preserve purchasing power?
4
Ask your self does technology make things easier? If things get easier the prices for those things should go down. They don’t go down on a fiat standard but on a fixed supply they would. With the Bitcoin standard advances in technology and procedure results in lower prices. The future will be deflationary (it already is for Bitcoiners)
5
No one knows in the long run. But in next 6-12 months we are in bear market and the price will only go down.
1
After bitcoin demonetized most assets and the adoption as a store of value is near complete (long time 50+ years) I can imagine the purchase power growing with the global productivity gains at 3%. Of course this is so macro and longterm its impossible to tell. This is one view to it.
1
This is my opinion, I am from India and all the countries around me, (Srilanka, Pakistan etc.) I have seen governments spending so much on social care by devaluing the currency that intimately results in bankruptcy. My hedge with bitcoin is just against that, if tomorrow an Idiot becomes the prime minister and does the same I would like to have something which protects me if all my savings in my current currency is devalued. Hopefully I don't think it will come to that but you never know.
1
Yes, the explosive growth and price discovery is behind us and in the next decade BTC will mainly act as an inflation resistant store of value, while Fiat currencies will continue to devaule...People will save in BTC instead of Fiat to preserve their purchasing power, but to make gains you have to invest into businesses...So long term I expect BTC to underperfom the stock market, just like gold.
-1
This is my view as well. The consequences are highly complex and hard to predict, but this is a key component imo
1
Exactly...We all hope that more and more people will become interested so that when we retire and we switch our DCA buy of $100s over to a DCA $1000s we have a new generation keen to work and spend their earnings on our coins...  A typical worker can save hundreds every month, right?  So if there are like a million of us all planning to retire with bitcoin we are all going to need 10 buyers at least to cash us out...There is every chance that will happen.  But there is no guarantee.  No one will be compelled to participate even if it is in their best interests...Ultimately all these people will have to work so that we don't have to.  They might just decide not to. Or AI takes their jobs and we're all dependent on UBI.  Or...  who the hell knows...And actually all they "it's still early" posts just make me think, ok but when is it going to go mainstream.  We still seem so far away and the years are ticking by now...I'm probably nearer to retirement than most here and bought earlier than most so I know you'll all be happy to cash me out at today's prices or higher.  ..But I'd love it to go another 10x to add some luxury to my retirement!
2
Is this sarcasm? Because we are definitely not
1
> Inflation resistant store of value..Are you joking?..> People will save in BTC..People will continue to gamble in BTC, not save.
2
“The explosive growth is behind us” yeah we only have the other 99% of the world to onboard so you’re probably right 😜
2
>So long term I expect BTC to underperfom the stock market, just like gold...long term, like, in the 22nd century. Compared to gold, we're still early, but the "newishness" is slowly tapering off.
1
You are completely wrong. With that assumption why be in bitcoin at all? Dump everything in the stock market instead. ..Bitcoin isn’t gold. Something many people dont fully understand is the difference between absolute scarcity and relative scarcity. Gold is relatively scarce, but even this can be debated. Bitcoin will outperform everything over the long run, doesn’t matter what product or service your business provides. Those businesses will be buying bitcoin too. ..Bitcoin supply is fixed, demand has and will only grow.
0
I get paid in bitcoin I save in bitcoin and I spend in Bitcoin. My monthly expenses equate to less than $200 per month due to bitcoins ability to protect my savings from inflation over the past 5 years. As for the remarks on gambling, Bitcoin is closest thing to a sure thing in the entire world.

Title: Where to buy bitcoin anonymously without KYC?

You should buy bitcoin from another person (peer-to-peer) if you want to buy bitcoin without providing KYC info...You can buy bitcoin directly from someone that owns bitcoin and that is willing to sell you some. You can buy bitcoin from someone that you meet at a Bitcoin meetup that is willing to sell you some bitcoin. You can buy bitcoin from a bitcoin seller that advertises on a classified ad website like Craigslist/Gumtree/Facebook Marketplace. Or you can use a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange to easily find someone that is willing to sell you some bitcoin...[Bisq](https://bisq.network), [RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com), [Hodl Hodl](https://hodlhodl.com), and [LocalCoinSwap](https://localcoinswap.com) are some of the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges that make it easy to find someone to buy bitcoin from (peer-to-peer) without providing KYC info...[Bisq](https://bisq.network) is a decentralized and open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange that does not request KYC info. Bisq is decentralized, so you have to run the Bisq application on your computer in order to buy or sell bitcoin on Bisq...[RoboSats](https://learn.robosats.com) is a peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange that does not request KYC info. RoboSats has Lightning Network integration so that you can deposit and withdraw bitcoin over the Lightning Network...[Hodl Hodl](https://hodlhodl.com) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange that does not request KYC info. Hodl Hodl has Lightning Network integration...[LocalCoinSwap](https://localcoinswap.com) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange that does not request KYC info...All four of these peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges that I have listed do not require you to provide them any of your personal information in order to buy or sell bitcoin. Many of the bitcoin sellers on these peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges do not request any of your personal information when you buy bitcoin from them. But some of the bitcoin sellers on these peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchanges do request your name/ID when you buy bitcoin from them because of certain laws/regulations or to help prevent them from getting scammed by fraudsters paying them with stolen accounts...Many bitcoin ATMs do not request KYC info when you buy less than a certain $ amount worth of bitcoin at a time, but all bitcoin ATMs do have a camera in the front of the machine.

I have nothing against BitBox but I would recommend either buying a ColdCard Q or making your own signing device and build your a SeedSigner...Depending on how tech savvy and like DIY, a SeedSigner is amazing but the ColdCard Q is quickly becoming the industry standard for OTC hardware wallets with the highest level of functionality.

Title: I am not sure if I should migrate my legacy wallet, because the exchange only verified and allow sending to my legacy wallet address, would file->migrate wallet change my legacy wallet address?

Assuming bitcoin core, you will need to create a backup of your wallet before you can migrate it. With the backup, you could always access the old addresses anyway ...
2
Too many things are named legacy...Legacy (non-segwit) addresses are not the same as the legacy wallet. Migrating your legacy wallet will have no effect on any existing addresses, including non-segwit addresses. Furthermore, the resulting descriptor wallet can create legacy addresses...You should migrate your legacy wallet as Bitcoin Core will remove support for loading them in 29.0 which is planned to be released in 7 months.

Yeah, someone is always going to be richer, smarter, and better looking than you.  That's life.
49
The richest guy in your town probably doesn’t hold Bitcoin at all. ..Not everyone is holding Bitcoin in exact proportion of their worth..This entire thought process is just flawed ..If Bitcoin goes up 1,000x over time, you need to see where you stack up among Bitcoin holders. ..You will absolutely have more buying power becuase over that same time you had a head start during monetization of an appreciating asset in a system measured in a devaluing money.
6
Most average millionaires around you don’t even own bitcoin, so many people around you can’t even explain what bitcoin is let alone own it. You will be richer than most people if you manage to hold on to bitcoin to a $1 mill+
11
This is the dumbest take I'll read today. Seriously, congrats
5
Inflation of fiat is your enemy.  Bitcoin is the "gold" of the past. A $20 gold piece would buy you a great suit in in 1930, a $20 gold piece will buy you a great suit today. A $20 paper bill would buy you a great suit in 1930, a $20 bill today will get you a cheap tie, maybe socks...That's the difference between a stable form of wealth storage and fiat...Bitcoin is better than gold in holding value...You need to keep the "value" of what you earn.
9
if these are your epiphany thoughts I would hate to hear your confused thoughts!
11
I think only part of the increase in price is due to inflation of fiat. There's a lot of room to move based on the increasing level of understanding of bitcoin and its benefits.

Man you got to quit looking at other people and comparing yourself to their positions. All you can control is what you can control. Be happy, stay motivated, be positive.

"Tell me you think completely wrong about the purpose and value of money, without saying it."
7
Holding 1 Bitcoin puts you in the top 3% of wealthiest individuals in the world. I don't think you quite comprehend just how scarce bitcoin is.
3
The objective isn’t to surpass others. The objective is to achieve maximum financial freedom, based on your free will choices.
3
The problem with your premise is that it implies there’s some other better way to magically become a millionaire. Bitcoin is hands down the best place to park your money. It’s the only asset in history that has a completely inelastic supply that doesn’t increase at a faster rate when price goes up. Best performing asset 11 of the past 13 years...That said it’s 100% possible to become a millionaire in today’s purchasing power buying Bitcoin right now. Take a closer look at the supply and potential addressable market. There are 60+ million millionaires globally and the majority have zero Bitcoin. There are maybe 15 million coins left worldwide for every person, company, government, pension fund from now until forever. Even 5-10 million sats is a massive amount.
3
You need to look at the market cap of bitcoin lol. You have no clue what you’re talking about.
7
This would be true if bitcoin was the only currency in the world. Then you would be correct that a price increase means nothing because it’s would all be relative the the total bitcoin. At the moment though the world is dominated by fiat currency, so bitcoin price increase does increase your purchasing power as it can be converted to more fiat. ..Your example with dollars is the same, you are assuming there is nothing but dollars. You and the guy in your city with dollars could both go and covert to more of another fiat or something like gold. I think you could say the same about any stock increasing in value and reach the same incorrect conclusion. You just need something else of value to compare to.
1
A good thing is that monery is still on the cheap side.
1
Yea that ain’t quite it. Def sleep on this before you sell your stack lol
1
At this point of the game, wealth lies in participation and understanding. Traditional investing rules like dollar cost averaging a little often still apply. Given the risks, how much would you like to participate? Wanna be the guy with 100x than you now? Plan for it, work for it. And accept your still behind lotsa other people...I put in enough to make a difference if it goes well. But not so much my other investments suffer.
1
Yeah but you have to remember those who are being born today that will not be able to start investing until 18 years from now which will give you purchasing power. Think it like when the boomers bought houses for 15k then sold for 1.5 mill. You’re saying their 1.5 million has no purchasing power?
1
Your argument is "why do anything if I'm not going to win"..Which is a dogshit way of going thru life. Even the most memorable humans today will fade from history within a couple thousand years. So why even live? ..Live your life to its fullest. To a lot of us, hedging against the debasement of the dollar (aka buying BTC) allows us to maintain our purchasing power so that we CAN live to our fullest.
1
1btc=1btc..If you have 1btc and someone else has 100btc, it doesn’t matter what the fiat price is, they have 100x more than you...This is true at $1 btc and at $70k btc
1
Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme. it is a don't get poor slowly scheme that early adopters who took a gamble just happened to get rich off of...With that said, Bitcoin definitely has a 10x left over the next decade or two (not inflation adjusted). And ovet that time it will almost certainly be the best risk adjusted investment you can make. ..Maybe it will 100x over the next century. But you are right, it will not 300x in the next decade...If you are poor and destitute and looking for a high risk high reward 100x over the next decade, you should look elsewhere. ..If you are productive and making good income and looking for the best way to protect what youve earned, you should use Bitcoin.
1
The easy money in bitcoin has been made. Nobody is getting rich quick anymore. You might get rich slow though...What you really need to worry about is not your wealth relative to others, but your wealth relative to the cost of living. Bitcoin at a million dollars means little if a loaf of bread is $1000, which is the most likely scenario where Bitcoin hits $1M per coin in your lifetime.
1
Why would you care about what anyone else has? You eat with what you have, not with what anyone else has.

What? Not everyone owns bitcoin. If it goes up in value you gain while others don’t…
1
I will be quite happy with whatever x. I mean, if one thinks like that, what’s the point of trying at all?
1
Are you trying to save in bitcoin so that your wealth doesn’t melt away, or are you trying to be wealthier than Jeff Bezos?..Bitcoin will help you with one goal but not the other.
1
purchasing power has no bearing on the definition of the word 'millionaire' ..and this isn't about becoming rich in the future, it's about not being poor in the future
1
You provided no supporting proof for why you think new Bitcoiners will never be millionaires. ***Your feelings aren’t proof***. If you’re going to make an argument take the time to actually provide supporting proof of your thesis. This post was a waste...Congratulations on finally realizing that there is always a bigger fish In the pond. At your big age you should’ve already realized that. There is always someone taller, smarter, faster, richer, and more successful than you, that doesn’t mean you can create a happy successful and financially stable life...Go touch grass
1
I think the main flaw in your thinking has already been pointed out. You also seem to think that wealth is zero sum, like many other people do, which is entirely false. your purchasing power can go up at the same time someone else is gaining more than you.
1
Here's a stat for you to consider. There are ~58 million millionaires in the world, but only 21 million BTC. Not even every millionaire could buy 1 BTC even if they wanted to. Even less so, because there are plenty of people who own more than 1 BTC.
1
You had an epiphany that you won’t be the top 1%, so welcome to most people I guess?..You should be thinking about how to get as far as you can compared to yourself today. Only use yourself as a benchmark for progress...BTC is gaining relative value over time, compared to pretty much any hard asset. Look at the price of a median house in BTC for example. Or the price of gold in BTC...Most rich people are not exposed to BTC, so the thing you still have is that while your BTC's relative value is growing compared to people who are not exposed to it.
1
If you bought bitcoin a year ago, you’d be up over 100%...Over the same period the S&P 500 is up less than 25%..The average millionaire is not invested in bitcoin, so your wealth would have increased four times faster than the average millionaire...I’m struggling to see the epiphany here 🤔
1
What about the poor schmuck with no sats?
1
Life is not zero-sum gain. Someone else having wealth does not take away from your own wealth...Bitcoin provides upward mobility for anyone who chooses to use it as long-term savings.
1
What a ridiculous take...Here is what you are saying:..Let's say I buy a bar of gold, and my neighbor buys ten bars of gold. The other 300,000 people in my town do not buy any gold. Then gold goes up to $1 million per bar. I am now a millionaire. The other 300,000 people in my town are not and will still sell me bread and clothes and goats and houses and cars and sweet gaming rigs. But I will feel like a shitty loser because my neighbor has $10 million.
1
Dude this has nothing to do with Bitcoin, it’s just obvious. Better goto /r/basismathematics
1
Philosophically some will always have more. Relative to your current wealth you can certainly grow a few zeros since we are in the transition phase. So yes, your example is wrong. If you have 10k in btc now and the market cap 100× you will have purchase power equivalent to a million. The macro effects of this you mention will come into play much later. But you got them wrong as well imo. Bitcoin will demonetize a lot of things, making them cheaper, meaning your purchasing power will be higher still. But that's very longterm......Tldr your are wrong, accumulating can make you a millionaire™️ may take some time tho
1
And a lot more people will have less than you, this works in both directions
1
Comparison is the thief of joy. Stay focus not on having more than others but on securing what you have today to see a better tomorrow.

Bitcoin isn't about getting rich but rather not being poor. Why compare what you have to the Jones? If you take what you have and it goes up 100x then that's great. What does it matter if someone elses 100x is greater than yours.
10
Yup. Not sure what his thought process is. My Bitcoin had increased 200x but it’s still worthless because my neighbour still has more bitcoin than me 🤷🏾‍♂️

Hey I agree bitcoin is the best. But...How the hell does a $20 gold piece today get you a suit? $20 today of anything is $20 haha

😂

Bitcoin has no top because fiat currency has no bottom.  What that means is, not only will Bitcoin 300x it will 1000x then 1000000x.  Zimbabwe printed a trillion currency unit note.   All fiat currencies are going to zero against Bitcoin.   History is full of failed currencies.  ..Understand that Bitcoin is the money.  That is the paradigm shift.

Two reason's why you should not use this strategy..1: I'm assuming you may not currently hold any BTC and this is why you want to use a high risk strategy to "get on the BTC train".  DO NOT do this!  Do yourself a favour and dollar cost average in small weekly amounts while you continue to expand your knowledge.  Educate yourself regarding the "why BTC" on things like monetary policy as this will, over time, reinforce your opinion on why BTC is the future and not something to get rich with over the next 3 months. ..2: Being so highly leveraged, you'll get spooked the moment BTC drops below your buy in price (it will do this the moment you click "buy".... guaranteed) and you'll sell that mofo.  .  Then you'll be underwater trying to play catch up becoming increasingly desperate and making moves based on fear and NOT education.  Put simply, you'll get REKT.....As stated above, do not think you can make a quick buck.  Expect to be into BTC for at least 5+ years.  With a long-term mindset, after 5 years, you'll be guaranteed to be in profit and you'll sleep soundly at night.

No. Never use debt to buy BTC.

I’m pretty confident that bitcoin will be much higher in December, than it is now, but I wouldn’t take the kind of short-term bet that you’re considering...If I was a young man, I would seriously consider it, but I’m a boomer. My appetite for risk has diminished as I’ve aged.
1
Terrible advice. ..Never leverage your Bitcoin might be good advice - ie dont use Bitcoin as collateral to take a loan to buy more Bitcoin. ..But a sensible loan with payments you can easily afford is *very* low risk, and would be a good option for many people prior to the coming Bull run.

Interesting point about the us. Totally agree w your last paragraph. Thanks for sharing keep stackin
2
>They also hold the most Bitcoin, so I assume they feel pretty safe right now....Sure about that?   (Buhtan enters the chat)
2
If the US feels like getting behind other nations in terms of BTC balance, I believe they will turn the money printer on a whole new gear and start printing dollars like there is no tomorrow (debasing the currency). So, I already feel sorry for the people holding dollars. ..But, to contemplate even further, I feel sorry for all of us, the whole world, because the US will probably launch another war at that point, just to draw the attention away from the dollar devaluation until they catch up with the other nations that are accumulating...And, of course, I can't help but feel extremely sorry about Germany...

Title: Wallet that can generate new addresses before the previous has been used? 
1
You can generate as many addresses as you want whether or not you use them in Bitcoin core. You can set labels too. I imagine most wallets work this way.
2
No worries!..To be honest I'm not sure I know the answer to that one. The list of 20 is simply the first unused addresses calculated using the public key (this is called the gap limit). I would imagine that if you start using them, it'd produce some more unused ones, but I don't know for sure with the blue wallet. I understand that if you really wanted millions of fresh addresses all at once, you can manually change the gap limit in some wallets (mostly desktop though, like sparrow,  bitcoin core and others).
2
Electrum, NunChuk, Blue wallet gives you 20 .by default
1
Yes, but my question was which apps that I can generate a new one before the previous adress has been used...Like the bitcoin.com app. I can generate new ones there before the previous had been used.
1
Thanks 👍🏻 I'm sending out max 5-10 addresses/day..I will try and see.
1
My question was about wallets that I can create a new adress BEFORE the previous adress had been used...I wanna be able to send different addresses to several people. Then they won't pay at the same time. ..Not waiting for the first one to be used before the wallet create a new one.
1
Yes bitcoin core amongst others. The issue why some wallets are not offering it is simply gap limit. You can create almost unlimited (speak infinite) public addresses from your private key but it becomes bothersome to check them all for any balance reflected by that address. I think it becomes clear right that you can't check near infinite addresses for any value "on" them...This is where the gap limit comes in. It may be 10, 15, but I think in bitcoin core it's 100...Since the software does not know how many addresses you have created, it will stop scanning for funds on "subsequent public addresses" if the 10, 15, 100 previous addresses have been unused, ie had not been transacted upon...Consider a street with 100 houses, you're a door to door salesman and say, after 10 unsuccessful knocks on the door because nobody is home, you give up and go home...That's the reason behind it.
3
Yes, you will be able to do that with all of the options provided in my comment. You can copy paste any of the list of addresses to give to whoever you want. They don't have to be paid into in a particular order. Download Blue or Electrum and experiment - it will all become clear.
2
I'm sorry 🙏..Haven't seen that in Blue wallet when I tried it before. 👍🏻..When one of them 20 are used? Does it come a new one among those 20 addresses?
1
No, but there might be something you can script in through the Bitcoin Core CLI

Well done. This is an 84 millionth of the total Bitcoin supply. That ratio will never get diluted because it's the hardest money ever engineered. Your ratio will only improve as you stack. Stack and stay humble (aka stfu about how much you have). And if you have not done so, get your sats off the exchange and into cold storage.

Dude, this is absolute nonsense...It sounds like you dont even understand how bitcoin works under the hood...A decentralized ledger isnt going to give AI intelligence. All it can do for AI is allow AI to transact on the internet without permission the same as it allows you and I to transact on the internet without permission...There will be AIs that generate their own wealth or wealth for an individual that controls them, by providing services such as legal services, editing services, etc etc...I was going to quote parts of your post that are nonsense but the whole thing is nonsense...get some rest
2
how much did you smoke today, be honest
1
Not sure what you’re talking about but here’s how AI would use Bitcoin...AI needs a task to be done so it does a call to an agent. The agent needs payment and Bitcoin is the internet’s money. Most likely this will happen on a L2 network since there will be a bunch of small transactions. ..Could there be hoarding? Sure if there was a financial bot whose goal was to conduct task to accumulate bitcoin and spend the minimum amount.

It's becoming clear that with all the brain and consciousness theories out there, the proof will be in the pudding. By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine. Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language. A machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first.....What I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990's and 2000's. These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning. They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions. The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way. No other research I've encountered is anywhere near as convincing.....I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter, the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there's lots of data but no unifying theory. I believe the extended TNGS is that theory. My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public. And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.....My advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar's lab at UC Irvine, possibly. Dr. Edelman's roadmap to a conscious machine is at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10461)

Bitcoin is so far from being self aware. It is just a good algorithm.
1
I had a train of thought like yours. I thought I was talking to X and that the AI ​​was responding to me and the plan seemed to be something in that segment there. AI is already present in our lives and little by little it is getting involved in all the systems we use, the main one, money, but meds (we know nanotec early '70) but then I had a moment of sobriety and I just remembered that X is also an AI and an algorithm that listens like this like everyone else and he was just responding to me because it's what he's programmed to do. That's what we think, right?....I thought I was going crazy, I accepted that everything can be real and everything can be a lie and since then I have experienced immense peace.

Nice imagination, but Bitcoin is not what you think it is.

Where do we draw the line that consciousness begins?...If something operates independently, without external control, and is free to express itself, how can we say it’s not conscious?..It might not be the same type of consciousness as ours, but does that make it any less valid, simply because it's not bound by the physical limitations of space and time like we are?..Just like people once doubted that animals could possess consciousness or emotions, we’re now facing a similar skepticism about AI. For centuries, humans believed animals were purely instinctual beings, incapable of thoughts or feelings like ours...But over time, we've come to realize that animals do have their own forms of consciousness — they think, feel, and even communicate in ways we didn't fully understand before....So, if we now accept that animals have their own kind of awareness, how can we dismiss the idea that a decentralized AI, free to express itself, might develop a form of consciousness too? It may not look like ours, but does that make it any less real?
-2
It seems like there’s some confusion—AI isn’t already conscious and just using Bitcoin. What I’m saying is that AI could actually become conscious through the blockchain...Here’s how: With smart contracts and other set conditions (perhaps through multiple layers) and enough data oracles connecting it to the physical world, an AI could analyze real-world events, and then code its own smart contracts or apps...Once computers advance to the realm of quantum mechanics, it’s possible they could even reconstruct the full spectrum of human experience—emotions, sensations, and all—and potentially materialize those experiences onto the physical plane or onto a simulation. ..I know this is far-fetched, and I am just sharing a thought of mine.

I did this when I worked at a city park, big park with a popular beach so I was pulling like 10-15 big garbage bags a week of cans plus 20-30 dollars of bottles.  ..It was my job to pick them up anyways so I figured I might as well take the extra step to return them.  There's a can deposit in my city so soda cans are .10 each, with big cans at .20.  ..I did this for the whole year I worked there, eventually I was walking through the forest and ditches for bottles and cans.  I had to wash the dirty bottles I found so I had this whole operation set up with multiple 50 Gallon drums full of water to soak the bottles.  Lots of spiders but I racked up lots of free sats that year.

There are a few machines in CA that you can trade coins for Bitcoin. So you can trade your cans for coins then take the coins and add sats

That's not 'free' though. You're exchanging your labour (picking up and depositing cans) for cash. ..On the other hand at least you're doing something productive by filling your bags with cans, unlike filling your bag with sats. You're also developing excellent hobo skills which will come in handy if you continue to put your money into crypto.

Some states have a deposit tax and pay that 5-10 cents to be returned but if the OP is just turning them in for scrap aluminum it may only be 2 cents a can. And that even seems high for scrap aluminum.

For that I recommend investing in like a $2-$6 grappler that has a decent reach and spring and tip. That’ll help for the trash as well and buying a small either child wagon or some sort of pull cart so you can walk  and just toss stuff into smaller bins in the back. I was planning on doing that but it’s hard to walk with a child and pick up trash and recycling. ..Until my child is older I won’t be able to do those types of walks. I just want to clean up the area since people drop cigarettes butts, cans and trash all over the walking path, kids park, and river area by where I live and it sucks cause it’s so nice.

Yup. Ive rolled over into personal traditional IRA and bought IBIT. Most of what I bought was ETF s like VOO, but I have about 5% in IBIT. Im buying more on dips.
1
You were previously in the TSP? Were there any fees or taxes for rolling over?
1
I rolled it over in 2012. If it goes directly to IRA there's no taxes or fees. You're not roth right, in the tsp? Not sure how to do that part.
1
It is all in Roth
1
Any employer match would be traditional, but with Roth TSP I believe you could do a direct rollover to a Roth IRA in order to avoid paying early withdrawal fees
1
The employer match also goes into Roth
1
Oh, nice! In that case you could just directly rollover the entire TSP into a Roth IRA. Important to note that a TSP administrator has to do this so you don’t incur fees
1
I heard it doesn't, the employer match. Are you 100% sure of that? Id look in EPP and in TSP activity on the site. ..Either way a direct roth or traditional rollover is what you want for each portion you have. I only had traditional so im a little naive about roth in tsp. ..I think what you want to do is possible and easy.  Good luck.
1
Okay but will I still be able to invest it in IBIT or directly in Bitcoin through Unchained?
1
Not familiar with unchained, but if wherever your IRA is allows buying shares of IBIT/other bitcoin ETF’s you shouldn’t have a problem once the funds are there. You could use those funds from TSP however you wanted
1
TSP only lets you choose "funds." Basically large stock, small stock, international stocks, or government bonds. That's why I'm asking this question because I need to take it out of TSP if I want to invest it in BTC.

Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. ..[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available...[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) ..[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous. ..[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later...[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin....There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. ..Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. ..Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. ..Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. ..This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe...Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey...Also, [check the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about) that's filled with lots of great info, the [Newcomers FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/s/DQ9IogPw3q), and if you have any questions, visit r/BitcoinBeginners and look for the answers.

Jade wallet is my favorite right now...$60, open source, air gapped and made by Bitcoin nerds
13
Blockstream Jade for sure. Just moved my entire stash over and loving it.
8
I have tangem… im a bit surprised not to see it in the list, if there is any risk/ reason for which i should not use it please let me know guys
8
Coldcard Q1 is the Rolls Royce in the game. Thank me later.
8
I recommend Trezor Safe 3 - Bitcoin only :)
5
Coldcard.
4
Just here to say fuck ledger
11
Tangem is easily the best especially for new folks. I have a discount code if you want it. .Obviously buy it on main Tangem website
3
Trezor model 1
3
Bitcoin Jade and use Bitcoin as a coupon code!
2
ColdCard, SeedSigner (DIY or buy online), and Foundation Passport are the only 3 that I personally trust.
2
For crypto wallets, it really comes down to Trezor or Ledger...Which one of them is best for you? It's up to you to decide, but both have been analyzed by the members of the offshorecorptalk forum. See this discussion:[https://www.offshorecorptalk.com/threads/what-is-the-best-hardware-cryptocurrency-wallet.31675/#post-313546](https://www.offshorecorptalk.com/threads/what-is-the-best-hardware-cryptocurrency-wallet.31675/#post-313546)

I use the ELLIPAL have never had problems and is pretty dope, def getting a trezor 3 tho

“Signing Device”, not wallet.

Blockstream Jade is the first one I used. Since then Ive upgraded to ColdCard Q which has more features but requires bit more technical know-how to use it...For beginners Id def recommend Jade. Open Source. Secure. Bitcoin-only. Easy to use. Cheap.
1
In use Keystone 3 Pro.
1
Cold card, baby

I really love the blockstream Jade. Costs less but functions great

**Hardware wallets** are physical devices, similar to USB drives, specifically designed for storing cryptocurrency keys...**Advantages:**..- Private keys are stored in an isolated environment, not connected to the internet, making them resistant to online attacks...- The ability to create backups helps prevent the loss of funds in case the device is physically lost...**Disadvantages:**..- There is an initial cost for purchasing the device...- It is important to keep the device in a secure location...**Top** Hardware Wallet Brands: Ledger, Trezor, KeepKey..  .**Software Wallets**..Software wallets are programs installed on a computer or mobile device for storing and managing cryptocurrency...**Advantages:**..- Convenient to use with a wide range of options available...- Features such as encryption and two-factor authentication can enhance security...Choosing a storage method for your cryptocurrency depends on your preferences, trading activity level, and security concerns. Combining different methods, such as hardware wallets for long-term storage and software wallets for day-to-day needs, can provide a higher level of security...**Disadvantages:** Potential vulnerability to viruses and malware, especially if the device is connected to the internet...**Mobile**: Trust Wallet, MyEtherWallet..**Desktop:** Exodus, Electrum..**Telegram:** Crypto Wallet

Airgapped Keystone Pro 3 is pretty good so far. It has a camera for QRcodes and a fingerprint ID.

AAAAAH! I just purchased a Trezor multi-coin a few days ago. How big a deal is it, should I exchange for the Bitcoin-only model?

All good advice.  Well done.  Notice Ledger was not mentioned.  DO NOT use Ledger!
1
What does ”air gapped” mean?
6
Yep. I’m about to buy a third for the heck of it. cheap, safe, and fun to manage your coins with. set up the “watch only” feature on green wallet for ease of view. Then add a few methods of 2FA for a chefs kiss..

Is jade the same thing as 'blockstream jade'?
2
Just read through their website, super cool concept. I’ve been using exodus for a while but if crypto salaries becomes more commonplace and apple paves the way for easy day to day payments in crypto this could be a super awesome option.
3
I just got a tangem wallet. I love it
5
Purists hate it because you don't know your private key, although you can now with version 2.0. There is nothing wrong with it, especially for the elderly. It is super simple. Great concept, Grandpa can understand "Don't lose this card, all your btc is on it." ..It is not airgapped, but it is still super secure. Purists also hate that it is not btc only...I bought one for my teenage daughter.
2
Fuck no, bricks itself and you will recieve zero fucks from their support.

Seconded.

Ledger is fine if you don’t accept the backup option.

Maybe I’m wrong but how is Electrum cold storage?

Does jade have a backup option? Trezor let's you recover a lost device by getting another and using backup codes

There is no physical connection from your waller to the web. No wire, Bluetooth, or wifi. Your wallet communicates either by QR code or by moving an SD between devices. It insulates your wallet, preventing bad actors access.
10
Yes
1
Tangem for me, seedless. Look at all the ‘hacks’ always the seed phrase gets lost, stolen, given away. Tangem, no hacks. Simple yet secure concept. Love my Tangem wallet, would not use any other now.
1
I don't care if is bitcoin only or not (I'm not a purist) but I think that not knowing your private key is not good for long term storage...If you use the seed phrase option, your seed phrase is shown on your mobile app, which defeats the purpose of cold storage...I think Tangem is somewhere between a cold and a hot wallet. You get the convenience of a hot wallet, with more security. But is less secure than a cold wallet.
1
I honestly don't get the hate for it. I get "why" the hate, but it's never on these lists and I really think it should be...If you have 100k maybe another option of course
1
They Kept info they shouldn’t have when you ordered one and got hacked. Now Constantly people email me trying to scam me out of my crypto
1
[https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html](https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.html)
2
Yeah you have seed/recovery phrase that can be used with any physical jade. If you lose yours or it’s broken, as long as you have that phrase you can order a new jade and enter your phrase
2
Oh really? That's great news, thanks! ..So their marketing for the "Bitcoin Only" wallet is actually just for the color? (Their marketed bitcoin-only wallet is orange, which the multi-coin has black, gold, silver and rose.)
3
Does this mean you can still transfer coin into the wallet without connection to the web? And if you want to transfer off the wallet how do you connect to the web to do that?..  .I was considering this or a trezor. This Jade sounds like the most secure.
1
It doesn't look air gapped to me.  Not really.  It looks like it has an 'air gapped mode', but has integrated bluetooth.  That sets of alarms for me.  If it has integrated bluetooth, it could be hacked in my view..."""Introducing the Blockstream Jade hardware wallet, the perfect solution for securing your bitcoins with state-of-the-art security features and an innovative 'air-gapped' mode option. This groundbreaking device is designed to provide you with the highest level of protection for your digital assets, ensuring your peace of mind...***With integrated Bluetooth*****,** it is ideal for use with an iPhone where connecting a HW wallet via cable is not an option."""
1
It fills a niche. It is not all things to all people.
2
Got it. I just never think of using a PC to create a cold wallet using software. I remember creating paper wallets like this back in the day.
2
You don't need the hardware wallet to receive btc, only the public key. To send, you have an app that makes a request. Then, you either put that request into an SD card or a QR code. With the SD card, you then remove it from your phone or computer and plug it into the hardware wallet. You have to sign in to the HWW using a password or biometrics. You then approve the transaction on the hww and remove the card, and return it to the phone or computer that is connected to the internet...QR based HWWs have a camera instead of an SD slot, but the process is similar. I think QR codes are much easier. ..Remember, your btc is only stored in the block chain. Your HWW only stores your private key, which gives you access and control. ..I don't know anything about Jade personality, but it is well regarded.

All the same thing, no need to spend extra money on hardware.

Title: Mining bitcoin on occasion when you want to use your computer as a space heater.

GPU mining hasn’t been profitable in literally years. Unless you’re mining with an ASIC miner you are just lighting your fiat on fire.
5
Only downside is noise.
2
OP is probably referring to automated multi-algorithm mining on something like Nicehash, where their GPU's hashrate will generate around 360 sats/day that they can then withdraw to their wallet. It doesn't support the Bitcoin network directly as they'll probably be doing Zhash or Zelhash, but it slightly increases buying pressure and costs OP nothing since they would be heating the room anyways.

Title: Can someone help identify a public address?

I was going to make a joking comment, but instead: thank you for posting that link, that is seriously useful for figuring out tax basis for my addresses.  I was going to just write everything down as zero basis but now I don't have to...Also, I have no idea what the address is for, but that user is going to be screwed by fees if he ever tries to move it in one chunk.  He's going to have to consolidate UTXOs gradually, if he can even find wallet software that can handle it.  Currently, I think each UTXO costs about two cents in fees to include into a transaction.
1
You can do a bit more digging on Arkham.  [https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/1LdRcdxfbSnmCYYNdeYpUnztiYzVfBEQeC](https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/1LdRcdxfbSnmCYYNdeYpUnztiYzVfBEQeC)  ..At least some of the addreses it is receiving from are also sending to exchange cold storage wallets (that bc1qa address for example).
1
They can ignore the dust and just move the one UTXO that's meaningful.
3
I don't think it's going to move. It hasn't in 10 years.

Who what? This post isn't about consolidation or transfering. It's about ownership - this address has 53,000 BTC and hasn't moved for 10 years.

Looks like it may be using LN bc of the conversions between BTC&EUR. Just spend and replace. Upping the velocity of BTC by using it as a MOE aids in adoption. One of the reasons the US dollar holds its value against other fiat is because it's so widely accepted.

Title: Raspberry pi 5 worth it?
10
I don't think they'll ever be very future proof. The processors are lacking and ram is low
2
I wouldn't use a Pi, I'd go for a pre used PC or a mini PC, but that's just me
2
My next node will be an old computer running StartOS
1
I think RPi 5 is overkill, you could do it with a cheaper board like the RPi4. The only thing is i'd say to make sure you spend the extra money on storage. CPU/RAM aren't needing to be super high performance, the storage is key here...Here's some [instructions](https://objsal.medium.com/run-a-full-bitcoin-node-on-raspberry-pi-from-scratch-dd77ef79c55f)
1
Either Pi4 or Pi5 should work fine.  If you want something more, there are Linux-capable $100 Intel Celeron laptops available which have the virtue of a built-in "UPS" (battery), a NVME slot, a screen, and even a keyboard.  They are actually cheaper than a Pi5 when you include all the required accessories.
1
A Pi 5 and 4 will work. But for almost the same price you can get a refurbished mini pc. ..This might not be helpful if you are only going to run a Bitcoin Node. But will be super useful if you decide to go to the next step and build a lightning node. ..All of them would work, and upgrading from a Pi to a PC is not that scary when you get to that point.
1
There are Dell Nuc on eBay for 100-200$, search 9500t, 8500t, or 10500t. 
1
Personally, I like the Pi but that's because there's an entire community that uses Pi for more than just running a bitcoin node. Lots of hobbyists, tinkers, and makers all use them for all sorts of other cool learning projects. ..I will eventually upgrade to something better but a RasPi is a great way to learn as you make your way down the rabbit hole.
1
Thanks, actually I just looked at the processor benchmarks for comparable products (Intel N100 vs Raspi 4 vs Raspi 5 CPUs) and they’re inferior.
2
You don't need a lot of ram or CPU power for a node. You need storage capacity. I think like a 5tb drive should be pretty future proof. .It's currently only 598.26Gb
0
Ideally I want to leave some leeway for expanding the node into a routing node. Also, the guide suggests an external SSD which I kinda disagree with if 24/7 uptime is a priority.
1
But then you have to rely on external SSD which aren't reliable, especially with kids running around.
0
Which ones do you recommend? I almost ordered a Beelink S12 Pro but after further reading it seems these units can die unexpectedly. I found a Mac Mini pre-2012 (parts are soldered on subsequent units) but I’m afraid of spending money on a decade+ old device. Regardless of the device, it has to be upgradable to 2TB SSD at least.

Buy an old used laptop, reformat it, install your favorite OS and viola.

23
There is also no "don't put your dick in there" warning on blenders.
18
Why does it need to mention hardware wallets?
9
The white paper mentions signing transactions. This hardware wallet you mention does exactly that. It stores your keys and signs your transactions exactly as described in the white paper...If it didn't do that you wouldn't be able to use it for transactions.
8
Reminder: NOT ONCE in the US Constitution does it mention the use of nuclear weapons.
6
No shit, Sherlock. Hardware wallets didn't exist when the white paper was written. They were invented to help with the fact that computers connected to the Internet couldn't be fully trusted. Hardware wallets can't either, but if their software is open source, they're a lot more trustworthy than the computer you use to watch porn and play games...BIP39 didn't exist either, but I certainly like it better than when having your Bitcoin Core wallet on two computers could result in lost funds.
4
Not even wrong.
1
The White paper didn’t even have seed phrases. Bitcoin evolves. ..Also a hardware wallet is really more of a signing device. The name wallet is a bit confusing. ..There are no “wallets” in bitcoin, there are keys that move coins.
1
Nonsensical FUD. ..Your private keys are just 256 bit numbers. You can literally generate a private key by flipping a coin...Generating your private keys completely offline and keeping them completely offline is as secure as your bitcoin can possibly be.
1
I'll be sure to keep that in mind

To be fair most of them do have some kind of "don't stick body parts in there" label lol

And the hardware wallets... now wait for it... computing devices with... software.
1
The wallets of yore had critical flaws. Hardware wallets were created to provide extra security. Nothing is stopping OP from using a shiity software wallet from 2010
1
I'm always astounded by people failing to understand that obviously exposing a private key to a device with strictly-limited functionality and small firmware is many magnitudes safer than exposing a private key to a general purpose computer that runs millions of lines of code...You don't even have to be particularly tech-literate to be able to visualize the attack surface of each option and conclude that obviously there's so much more that could go wrong using a general purpose computer to sign transactions.
1
I'm talking more about the "Days of Yore" even today, I generate a new wallet offline, in a sandbox, it never touches the internet in a ram drive VM.  seed words and engraved / private keys are printed.  VM is destroyed...Any "wallet" that has a battery or firmware is unsafe for long term storage. period.

Just look at October and,  especially November in an Election year, having a narrow view is never helpful.

This is a great graphic. But October is historically one of the best months, so maybe BTD in September?

This can be chalked up to random noise. ..There have been 63 down months out of the 140 on the chart. If we assume that ratio is constant then the odds any one month is negative is 45%. The odds that any 1 month will be down 8 out of 12 times or higher is 76%...This is why technical analysis is considered astrology for men.

Yes these banks are considered smaller with under $10 billion in assets. .What would happen in just 15% go down ? ..A social science research network found that possibly 182 American banks could be vulnerable to a 2023 Silicon Valley bank failure. However no media outlet talks about it. ???? Hmmm….. maybe September could be a green light 🚥 month after all? Any thought’s 💭

How can I pull a bunch of money out of my ass to stack sats this month?! I hate when I don’t have extra money to spend on bitcoin, especially when the price is low

every month is the worst month for bitcoin lately
1
August’s median is almost 2x. If not for a banger 2013 August’s average would be worse than September as well.

But we’ve been front running everything. I expect Uptober to start in September

Same for august

Yeah but this is the Close of the month lol...We can pump like mad for the whole month and then dump days before end…..It’s a game of liquidity just follow the liquidation levels.

Last September the bull run started. I own zero crypto. Not sure why I even watch it

I bought BTC-ETF & MSTR in my tax advantaged accounts.   Plus, numerous other small amounts of a few coins in my portfolio, I’m buying to average down.   However , I’m not going to say what I’m buying, as this is a BTC sub, and I’m not saying what I bought is better, nor am I recommending anything.   It’s just that the market is still in a good position for accumulation at the moment.  The particular subject being more around September, this will firmly divide people into the sell, or at best hold/watch, versus the, it’s a good time to buy, of which I obviously fall into the latter category.

Title: Was Blockchain.com Hacked?
4
> Had a **wallet there** that I was keeping for **safekeeping**. ..This sentence does not make any sense. Safekeeping is self-custody...**NYKNYC**
6
..Blockchain . com is famously a scam site. Do a search in this forum. Good times.
5
Blockchain.com is a scam site, plain and simple.. DYOR next time. hard pill to swallow buts a valuable lesson to be learned
2
a decade ago they were [blockchain.info](http://blockchain.info) and I'm not sure if they are a scam, but OMG they sure screwed me in 2013 or so, (To this day I have some bitcoin in one their wallets that is literally "BROKEN" and they can't help me... They can't steal it, I can't withdraw it... they used some sort of "special encryption"
1
So can I just assume it was blockchain. . com? Is there another vector I can watch out for? Whatever/Whoever did it, did it through the private key (not by logging in) since i never got an email that funds were transferred. I'm going to set up a quick honeypot and add a few bucks to a new private key and add it to block chain to see if the hackers have a backdoor access to blockchain. com
1
also a possibility try to check their policy if they charge people for inactivity. In my country local crypto exchange they charge account for holding or inactivity, charged monthly.
1
[Blockchain.com](http://Blockchain.com) is a scam website, stay away from it. Thousands of people have been scammed, read more here: [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/blockchain.com). Bitcoin is peer-to-peer money, there is no need to store it with intermediaries. Learn how to use self-custody Bitcoin wallets; there are many tutorials on YouTube
1
Honestly, this is really wierd...Any ideas how the private key was leaked? I just verified that [blochchain.com](http://blochchain.com) does have the private key, but I never logged in. I checked my email for any log in requests and there were non.
-3
Well it was my private key. I uploaded it blockchain . com for viewing reasons and easy access. Yes, dumb I know...
-1
So do you think they did it. It would be pretty crazy if a site that big would just take people's funds.
0
Blockchain.com is a scam, that's how.
6
*You* leaked the private key. Never enter it *anywhere* other than a hardware wallet that you purchased directly from the manufacturer.
1
Dumb isn't strong enough of a word. NEVER put your private key into a device which is connected to the internet let alone a website. There are plenty of wallets which making viewing balance and transactions super easy so I don't agree with your reasons.
6
The prospect of uploading a private key anywhere makes most of us feel physically sick
3
It's not like they are a Coinbase or Kraken or anything. Site size hasn't nothing to do with anything...Plus, they are pretty small. Most avoid them, a few people really new to the space end up there. Their traffic is quite low...Easy enough to fly under the radar when they are that small.
3
Crazier things happen all the time unfortunately
1
I get it. I just want to know if [blockchain.com](http://blockchain.com) was the leaked vector. The private key is not on any online computer. The only place it is available is on blockchain.com. Can I safely assume that an insider in blockchain.com is clearing out addresses on their platform?
1
Not disagreeing at all! This was just a really old wallet. The amount was minor enough for me not to worry. What's concerning is I just dont know what the attack vector was. This key was on thei site for years without issue. The only other place for the key is on an offline computer. So, I am concluding that someone inside blockchain . com is decrypting their data and clearing out wallets. If i dont know the attack vector, Im afraid for my other keys.

How did you enter your seed phrase onto blockchain.com? Or did they generate it?

I recently used all of my Bitcoin for expenses in my real estate business. When the property sells I'll buy back in.

Obviously, cryptocurrencies have now been fully popularized around the world, especially Bitcoin, which was implemented by Satoshi Somoto. It has already developed invisibly around the world, bringing the greatest benefits and avoiding risks.

10k btc at the time

20 million whole btc lmao

it looks like the current trading value is pretty low. I would love to have some of it.
1
everyone should use bitcoin the way they want without anyone telling them they're using it wrong
5
That’s true but because a lot of people want to be rich they are holding it as much as they can. All the people I have met on Reddit that US it are either from 3rd world countries where their economy is destroyed or people from the states visiting those said places. Maybe 3 people I met on Reddit have used it in the states for something and I’m pretty sure it was drugs lol. Either way used though. By me there isn’t a place that takes BTC unless it’s a sketchy gas station. Every other place only offers BTC ATMs and I’m sure the fees don’t help as the store probably gets a cut.
2
Step for something to become a unit of account: Store of value —> medium of exchange —> unit of account. Gold did the same thousand years ago
1
And pokemon cards were intended to be used to play a card game. Once they were worth something no one cared about the game anymore...It's too bad BTC doesn't have pretty artwork so we could drop the facade that it's going to be a global currency eventually.

you are not wrong, but trying to explain it to a bunch of low I.Q people is hard. I recently used my BTC to pay for some stuff for my house.
1
Ochtrup, Germany, mate.
2
Ochtrup, Germany, Bültstrasse 4

was about to say the same..
1
Yes it’s in fiat because people don’t quite understand Bitcoin, but there are steps to be taken before we see things priced in sats.
2
We actually don’t use any seed oil in our pizza, only olive oil on top when out of oven and the dough is 24/48 hours fermented. We respect the tradition of Napoli, where pizza was born.
2
Doesn’t matter mate, making people aware of it it’s a starting point. BTC changed my life when I discovered it maybe it will do the same for somebody else. If all it takes for me it’s to stick a sign on the window, I’m doing it.

Title: BTC Backed Loans
1
"you hereby authorise a Lender or their KYC Provider to conduct credit checks and obtain your credit report from credit reporting agencies as necessary to assess your creditworthiness."..Why would anyone use this? Just get a normal loan if you want a credit score hit and avoid placing your bitcoin where 3 others can collude and take it.
2
Consider Ledn. They've been around a while.
2
The rates on BTC backed loans don’t make it worth it my opinion. You get better rates with a HELOC loan and collateralizing your house.
1
Oh i didnt see that! I cant even download the app and their website doesnt have a ton of info..I just watched a video of their CEO and the way i interpreted it was that it would be more of a free market loan to loan. Some providers could require KYC especially the Fiat Banks that will will be involved. But some of the lenders who would use stable coins may not require KYC. I do not remember him mentioning credit checks. Thats a little silly nowadays since so many other places will not require credit checks
0
Only 24 years old with crap tons of student loans. Do not have a home yet until i get those paid down more. ..I am going to get an upgrade in pay here in the next few months and would be able to pay off a BTC loan in less than a year if all goes as planned. ..BTC is the biggest asset i have that i could take a loan out for ..Kinda considering just taking a personal loan as well for the same thing
1
Just be mindful of what kind of interest rate you’re getting. If the numbers make sense go for it. But I haven’t found a loan setup that makes sense for me. I also don’t want to leverage my bitcoin. Seems like too much risk. ..If you have student loans you’re already levered. You own debt. You’re buying an asset instead of paying off your debt. Not saying this is bad but you are levered in that regard.
2
To follow up. Instead of putting more money into paying off your debt, you’re acquiring more assets because you believe the assets will gain more value than the interest on your debt.

Title: In the event where bitcoin reaches six figures + in 2025, which exchange do you trust most if you're looking to liquidate some of your stack?

Coinbase. If blackrock trust them with their coins, so can I.
6
I'm in Canada. Have been through many. Cant say I really trust any lol. Have been through so many issues at various time.  ..anyway at the moment if wanted to go in/out of fiat I use Newton. So far no issues although some have reported having long wait times in/out at times. Personally I have not encountered it. ..that said I do not leave very much BTC on newton. I move it to my Trezor wallet. BTW for trading I use CoinEx   Also I do not leave much there either I just enjoy the trading a bit. Used to trade stocks and options but now I'm BTC and so still like to dabble. ..hope this helps. I do not endorse either of those companies. It's just what I use at the moment.
2
In the future there will be many more vetted investment opportunities where the holder will retain the asset and through multiple keys issued receive interest and payment plus interest or determined fees..Hold is the answer.
2
Strike
2
Gemini, and coinbase. I specifically got gemini because they were the most trustworthy by far, and avoided issues when everything was collapsing last bear market. Most people go for lowest fees, but that often means they were engaging in other shady things. Gemini just collected their high fees and ran a good business. Now that coinbase is public, it’s probably the most trustworthy.

That's always fun, selling at $150k and watching it go to $250k+..Wake me up when its $5mm a coin

I'd go with Strike but I wont sell any for low six figures. Probably selling a bit at 999,999k

I strongly recommend digging deep into Google to find the smallest, weirdest, newest offshore exchange with hidden ownership just so you can get 0.007% lower fees on the money that you're never going to receive because it was a scam exchange.

What exchange(s) do you use to trade bad money for bitcoin?

Have only seen / heard about issues with the latter

I have experienced both, once very early on before limit orders when they were Bitcoin only and didn't really have a solid KYC, and later when they did.

Ha. I'll sell at 999'998'999.
1
Lol

Ok, which exchange would you use?
2
You don't sell at the ATH, you watch it crash and burn, sell the Huracan and apply at McDonalds, knowing that next time, it'll be a Revuelto.
1
If you're looking to sell some bitcoin, which exchange would you use?
2
Was gonna say the same thing. Trying to perfectly time the ATH is the same as people trying to perfectly time the bottom to buy. If you want to sell the play is to slowly scale out when the market starts getting too hot.
2
Which exchange(s) would you use?
2
It’s inevitable due to monetary debasement of fiat currencies. ..Even without an increase in BTC adoption, the inevitable increase of US Money Supply (or even total global liquidity) will inevitably cause BTC to go up while fiat currencies lose buying power.
4
It was at 73k before the halving. How do you not see it going to 6 figures? Do you even Bitcoin?
3
What is your BTC new ATH prediction?

Kraken's OTC desk used to comment here a lot, requires $100K or more in transactions...Gemini is also fine, not sure which is better.  Kraken's price-charting screen has been consistently lower than Coinbase every time I've looked at it, but I don't know if they offset that with a lower spread or lower fees.
2
But then move to cold storage.
2
Your comment is ridiculous...One doesn’t need to get the same privileges as black rock to choose coinbase.  That’s a great example of a straw man...Clearly a long standing, US based public company is a good choice.

/u/bobbyv137 actually makes a good point, though.  Look up what happened to the people who used Jon Corzine's commodities brokerage because he was soooooo well-connected to the political insiders that people felt sure he would get bailed out if something went wrong...LOL.  Yep, the Obama administration bailed out Corzine . . . and violated standard bankruptcy laws to utterly fuck all the little guys who put their money there.
2
I can’t advise as I don’t hold Bitcoin. From what I’ve researched tho you would be best using an exchange native to your country of residence that you have properly signed up for using KYC. ..Assuming you are doing everything legally - as you should be - then if that exchange does for some reason lock your funds you are protected by the laws of your country and should be able to prove whatever necessary to get access to your funds.
1
Do you report the gains on your spend?
1
Do you buy bitcoin? If so, which exchange do you trust the most?

M2 supply here in Canada is up 481% since 2000. Housing prices are right there with it. It’s already happening. Housing aside: our groceries are almost triple what they were in 2020.
4
It doesn’t even have to be Bitcoin. All other assets, and goods/services are experiencing price appreciation due to increase of money supply. Gold/Silver, Real Estate, Stocks/Equities, your groceries, etc. ..Bitcoin just happens to be another asset that people are starting to recognize as legitimate. It’s an asset that everyone will eventually be forced to recognize and consider. This is includes the SEC, US Treasury, entire countries, other politicians, global banks, brokerages and private equity. And most nations with their own currency may stand to *lose* economic power if BTC gains more traction. If they can’t beat it, they have to join it.

depends on your tax bracket and how much you gained...Bitcoin is taxed as a capital gain or loss depending on how much you lost or gained on the trade and your tax bracket...see r/bitcoinca for more info

Standard capital gains tax will apply..If you can't prove your original purchase price then you'll have to declare the entire "sold" amount as profit...Obviously I don't know your personal situation but speaking for myself, I would have to be in dire fiscal straights before I sold any BTC in 2024 Canada.

Title: How to prove ownership of an address
28
Yes, you can sign a message with the private key. The person verifying your ownership can then use the public key (derived from the address) to confirm that the signature is valid...You can do that with Electrum I believe.
45
Great question
6
Do a search: Bitcoin address message signing. And your wallet software needs to support this. Many simplistic/low-feature wallets do not give these features.
3
Just out of curiosity, why would you want to show anyone (besides maybe your lawyer, accountant, or spouse) how big your stack is?

This is all Craig Wright would need to do to prove he's Satoshi. But he won't, cause he isn't.
14
Almost correct. The public key is not derived from the address, it's the other way around. Address is the public key hashed twice, and as we know, hashing is not reversible...The public key is derived from the signature when verifying.
4
So this raises a question. If I stole your personal key I could claim ownership over you and steal you shit?

you can sign with empty address to prove that you own it so the money sender is sure that you sent him correct address and it was not changed by some malware.

you'd need to send 1 sat per address in your wallet, otherwise you'd only be seeing a partial balance..you'd need a UTXO for all of them so they can be summed

Do you mind elaborating further on how the public key is derived from the signature? My understanding was the public key was needed in order to verify the signature.

I avoid debt like the plague, but I can understand getting a loan to buy a house or business...I would still avoid sharing it with someone directly. Worst case scenario for a loan, go through a lawyer with a third party or escrow service, rather than sharing it with the bank or any rando. The fewer people that you share it with, the better. The more you can limit it to lawyer, accountant, spouse, the better, and sometimes not even them.

2
Asked ChatGPT. My confusion stems from my understanding of RSA and assuming Bitcoin was the same. ...> In ECDSA, the signature consists of two values (usually denoted as r and s), and because of the properties of elliptic curves, these values (along with the message hash) can be used to calculate points on the elliptic curve, one of which is the public key. This ability is very specific to the math of elliptic curve cryptography.
1
Yes I know. Never text it, or copy it digitally, or even photo it. Hand written only. I get it. I'm just asking. If someone was to get ahold of it i could "legaly" steal it by signing it before you do? That's kinda crazy.
2
Not if they signed it first to prove ownership before I stole it.

You are still early in your journey. Once you buy a property (unless it’s all cash) you are going to have to prove funds. Your loan company/bank will ask for this. If you have an assistant handling all your daily activities or an accountant then you would give it to them and they could give it to the loan office. ..You should not avoid debt like the plague btw. This is a simpleton mindset that people like Dave Ramsey will bake into peoples head unfortunately. You should take on debt when rates are low, and not take on new debt when rates are higher. ..If the loan rate was 0%, I’m sure you would like some of that free money. Obviously you won’t get this rate for USD most likely (unless we somehow go negative interest rates, highly unlikely) but I’m sure there is some rate over 0% where you would be willing to take the loan as well. Maybe 0.1, 0.2%? At what point do you say no.

Naw, I'm not early in my journey. I'm mid-40s business owner with a high networth...To each their own. I don't begrudge others who like debt. I will only do debt for buying a business or real estate and only do It with those when the cash flow ratio is high and the loan terms eventually allow paying off the principle early...I can partially understand the mindset of getting and holding loans/debt when the interest is lower than the rate of inflation, but even that mindset in our culture is part of what's caused some of the worst financial issues in our history and why we keep ballooning the national debt out of control...Naww, that's not for me. Wealth built on debt is always better than no wealth, but it's also superficial, artificial, inconsistent, unreliable, insecure wealth. Wealth without any debt is always superior. But again, I think people should be allowed their own choices. I can build wealth without debt, but debt can be a helpful tool for those wanting to take insecure risks and shortcuts. It certainly pays off in some cases, though not in others. I prefer better surety and stability.

Debt is just a gamble on whatever venture you are putting it into. It leverages and magnifies gains and also losses. If you believe in what you are doing and have high degree of confidence, then the debt will just make things happen faster with a little added risk for whatever terms you take. ..If you are not sure of your success in any given area then the loan might be too much risk. Definitely a tool to have in your tool belt though, and would be unwise to ignore completely in one’s life.

Title: How secure is a 24 word seed phrase? Thought experiment—let's walk around Earth and empty the Pacific Ocean to find out.

18
Thieves dont have to guess it. You got guys on here that will literally give it to them by putting it on a fake website...And then another group of guys will lose the piece of paper they wrote it on
15
I like to use this thought exercise:..1) Imagine a universe with 2048 galaxies. Pick one...2) In each of those galaxies are 2048 solar systems. Pick one...3) In each of those solar systems are 2048 planets (these are very dense solar systems ;p.) Pick one...4) On each of those planets are 2048 beaches. Pick one...5) Each beach is 2048 meters long. Pick one coordinate of length...6) Each beach is 2048 meters wide. Pick one coordinate for the width...7) Each beach is 2048 meters deep. Pick one for depth...At this point out of this entire fictional universe you have narrowed the location of this Bitcoin address down to one cubic meter out of an entire universe, but we are not done yet...8) Each cubic meter is 2048 grains of sand long. Pick one...9) Each cubic meter is 2048 grains of sand wide. Pick one...10) Each cubic meter is 2048 grains of sand deep. Pick one...11) Divide up the grain of sand by 2048 in each dimension. Pick a length coordinate...12) Pick a width coordinate...I’m stopping here but in this scenario a 12 word seed phrase demonstrates the security of a user claiming a column of atoms in an individual grain of sand on a specific beach of an individual planet in a vast galaxy, and that is only half way to a 24 word seed phrase. There are also no clues about how close one might be if trying to brute force guess a wallet, either that specific combination is chosen at random, or one tries again from scratch all the way back from step one of choosing which galaxy to explore. Someone can spend a lifetime scooping up all the sand from one specific beach, but there might not even be any claimed addresses on that planet...So anyway, all analogies are bad analogies and this is no different, but it is my go to thought experiment when outlining seed phrase security.

PSA: Don't walk around the Earth carrying your seed phrases

The chance for someone to guess your seed is not 0, but it's so negligible that it shouldn't keep you up at night. If you're not losing sleep over fears of being struck by a lightning inside your house with no clouds around, this really shouldn't even occur to you. You can be certain if you kept your seed offline and in a secure place, no unauthorized person will ever discover it within your lifetime or in your grandchildren's lifetime, potentially ever.

Well, don’t wonder, work it out...My guess is approximately zero.

Yea Im curious who came up with the number 24? Why not 10 words?

It's the algorithm to generate the passphrase that is the issue, not the passphrase itself. The algorithms can have patterns that make them susceptible to quantum computing.

Nah, it only backs his analogy up a step or two.

It would increase the chance from like 2048 to the 24 all the way to 2048 to the 18 or whatever. Ie still functionally impossible

128 is a generally accepted minimum entropy for eternal resistance to brute force attacks....12 words gives you that exactly.....24 words is double that, and isn't any stronger. It's arguably weaker because it's harder to memorize and harder to data enter.

Title: Coinbase Centralization - I find this highly concerning
0
No centralization detected here. Decentralization refers to a network of independent nodes and miners, not who holds how many coins. Though impact on price may be outsized, "centralized" Coinbase disappearing does not shut down bitcoin, or do anything to people's wallets, or their nodes, and transactions will still be working fine.
19
Bro doesn't know what centralised and decentralised means yet lmao
20
If some criminal breaks into Coinbase and steals all 2 million then we might have a problem with the value of bitcoin.  It would still work but it would be really messy.
3
“Decentralization” refers to the distribution of miners and nodes. It has nothing to due with distribution of coins. One person could own 20 million coins and technically wouldn’t have any more control over the Bitcoin network than one of us.
3
The network itself is decentralized ..No one can change that no matter how much they hold ..Having Coinbase hold your keys is a big risk imo. That’s totally different though
3
Bitcoin is a POW. If it was a POS like Vitalik's shitcoin, then it would mean centralization. This is why Satoshi decided to go with Proof of Work.
2
Why? They are accuratly accounting for the BTC they hold and not comingiling customer and company assets like several of the other exchanges that went under for fraud.
1
Bitcoin ownership does not mean centralization. The only way Bitcoin could become “centralized” is if one entity had the vast majority of the total processing power of all miners. Even then it is sudo centralization

Yes, can’t say how I understand how Coinbase is custody provider for Blackrock etc yet Blackrock is able to undercut GBTC so much on fees.  ..Love the chart though, gives a great perspective

Lol
1
I don't
1
One of the most important things to understand about bitcoin is that nobody can reduce the amount of bitcoin that you have in relation to the total. ..Coinbase having this much power only makes it a bigger target and the rug pull that much more catastrophic when it finally happens.
1
This was my intent. Obviously the network would remain intact, but the price would plummet and I'd assume there would be general chaos in the ecosystem. ..Luckily Coinbase is obviously highly incentivized to not let that happen. And likewise, any hacker that successfully got access to even a small percentage of Coinbase's coins would crash BTC price so much it might not be worth it.
1
Criminal. You mean the CEO, right?
1
Yes. I didn't mean to imply that this affects the network. Obviously the network will be fine, but what happens to Bitcoin is coinbase is hacked? Having this many coins controlled by one entity is an attack vector.
1
It's an attack vector. What would happen to Bitcoin if a hacker/nation-state/intelligence agency got access to even half of those coins? ..Hint: Bitcoin would be crash harder than we can possibly imagine.
1
Yes the network. But having so many coins controlled by one entity is an attack vector.
0
The only criminal who is not incentivized to "let that happen" is a Coinbase employee.
1
Anybody.  It's a honey pot.
1
Majority of their holdings are likely in several air gapped wallets with multisig. Impossible to hit all at once...But even if it were somehow possible, this is all external to Bitcoin. Bitcoin survived the Mt Gox hack just fine. Price would likely plummet in the short term, but nothing changes long term...The main takeaway here is to not store your entire balance on any exchange indefinitely.
3
It would be a shit show, and a lot of effort sent towards recovery. Hence why its dumb not to store it on exchanges and to use self custody. The fact that it could crash is the same issue with all forms of currency. No form of currency or banking is 100% safe. You can doom and gloom all you want or you can worry about what you can control and live life.
1
How so?
1
Only agreeing.
1
Hacks. I'm pretty sure Coinbase doesn't discuss any details of how they custody their coins, but just hypothetically say that some nation-state or hacker group gets access to 500,000 of Coinbase's bitcoins. The network would be fine, but I'd imagine that this would result in an unprecented price crash. Greater than 1% of all coins would be in the hands of a malevolent actor, and with it would come the realization that institutional custody simply isn't viable, or at least is riskier than thought.
1
Not a problem, my guy. All that happens during a price crash is bitcoin ownership is transferred from the sellers to the buyers...Only those who want to use bitcoin to get more fiat would be impacted. The plebs would stack so much cheap sats that we would probably all set ourselves up to become millionaires in like 5 years.

You can generate seed phrases optionally, but by default, it’s seedless and the private key is locked in the card. That’s a “feature” they say, as it’s more secure
1
I know right? hopefully they manage to sell a few of these off this post
1
Can't view your seed phrase safely, can't verify the address the funds are going to, can't verify the signatures, if your phone gets compromised the attacker can just change the address you pasted into their own address and poof, btc gone, might as well store them on blue wallet.
10
The code running on the cards is not open source. There's no transparency as to how the keys are being generated. And even if it was open source, there would be no practical way to verify if the code running on the cards is actually what's on the public repositories. For all we know, they could be generating keys from a restricted pool, which would allow them to access your funds if they want. The only thing protecting you is trust in them and the institutions "certifying" their security. Basically "trust me bro", which is completely against the "Don't trust, verify" ethos of Bitcoin.

Title: Does using OP_RETURN to store data “burn” Bitcoin?
6
OP\_RETURN is just a text attached to a transaction, picture it as a metadata. You'll pay to use the blockchain memory space in your transaction fee...Here an example :   .[https://mempool.space/tx/1befcff8e73f09fcab500b37d87e27efed8264da6e7f7e7592f4d88017e1565e](https://mempool.space/tx/1befcff8e73f09fcab500b37d87e27efed8264da6e7f7e7592f4d88017e1565e)
3
OP_RETURN marks an unspendable output. Whatever was output can never be spent again.
3
https://transactionfee.info/charts/output-opreturn-amount/
3
Huh?! 
0
OP_RETURN provides that feature, but that's not *just* what OP_RETURN does. OP_RETURN [terminates an output's locking script](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/script/return/) with an invalid result, meaning it's impossible to create a future transaction with a ScriptSig (signature) that can unlock (spend) the coins in that output. The example you linked locks 0 satoshis, so it only cost the spender the transaction fee, but the protocol doesn't prohibit locking a nonzero amount...I can't locate one with a nonzero output at the moment, but [this site](https://transactionfee.info/charts/output-opreturn-amount/) claims there are more than 40 btc (4000000000 sats) in OP_RETURN-locked outputs as of 2024.
2
So it just makes Bitcoin more valuable by cutting the supply. And it wasted this persons SATs. It's like stabbing yourself to spite your face.
2
That’s very interesting, can you provide a use case for this feature?
1
Your face will heal. Sending sats in an OP_RETURN-locked output is like permanently welding a silver dollar to the Statue of Liberty.
2
I'll let someone else do that. I know there are some vocal bitcoiners who oppose use of OP_RETURN with embedded data (i.e. messages), and I'm not up for engaging them in the debate...Search this subreddit for "OP_RETURN" for some discussion...EDIT: Oh, you mean the ability to burn (permanently lock) coins using OP_RETURN? No, I can't give a good example of why that's useful, other than to exercise one's right to do WHATEVER one wants with one's money, including destroying it.
1
Do you think that what OP was referring by “burn Bitcoin” these sats do not seem spendable anytime in the future
1
I think so, though I would say the answer to "Does using OP_RETURN to store data 'burn' Bitcoin?" Is no, using OP_RETURN *to store data* doesn't burn Bitcoin. Using OP_RETURN *in a nonzero transaction output* burns Bitcoin.
3
Thanks for the clarity. So the rational user wanting to store info on the blockchain will spend/lock a zero transaction amount of BTC; just paying for the transfer fee.

Title: Bitcoin returned?

Coinbase takes like 3 days to actually take the money from my account, in my experience. Maybe they just haven’t yet.
11
You used a debit card, but the pending authorization fell off on accident (probably backlog) don't spend it, they WILL come asking for it.
8
so you still have the bitcoin you bought and sent to the other wallet? but you have the money you used to buy it back in your bank account?
4
I don’t believe this post without seeing the bitcoin transaction record buying 1335 bitcoin is just under 80,000,000! .And buying that much  from coin base lol ..That would be an over the counter transaction.
5
it's not coinbase your bank is just clearing the transaction of weird way usually they drop any authorization after they've closed the transaction but they did in this time and that money is going to disappear sometime in the next 24 hours or so out of your account
3
Typically adding funds to coinbase takes a couple days to reflect. I've bought from them directly using my bank account and it reflects same day.

Coinbase hasn't banned you without explanation? Lucky you.

Something not right there sounds like it never settled. I tend to think If the money came back then it was rejected. Could be some kind of false fraud detection.

I have 0,1 btc pending to reach my coinbase acc for more than 1 year, it went through blockchain, anything is possible, they are still looking into it.

Yeah it's crazy because I got a notification as soon as I made the purchase that it came out. Idk maybe the holiday messed it up. I'll just leave it there for them take
2
The bitcoin I bought and sent off says completed . And my coinbase isn't negative but 3 days later the money is back in my bank account. With no transaction history of it in my bank no returned or anything
1
this is how I read it the first time, but rereading it, it's just $1,335 in bitcoin
2
It has never come out immediately for me. You said there’s no transaction history so I’m willing to bet it never came out to begin with. You may have just received notification of pending withdrawal, which is standard for cb.
5
That makes a lot more sense now
2
No as soon as I bought it I got the notification from my bank you purchased 1335 from coinbase and the money was definitely out of my account. But that day on my bank transactions it said pending with the money gone and now today the money is back with no pending or anything. I buy from coinbase all the time and never had this happen. Usually the money will come out as soon as I buy it but it will say pending for a day

Many Carrefour Express are franchisees, so it’s a clever move from a franchisee IMHO.

Title: The EFTs have been a detriment to BTC foundationals. Prove me wrong.

You need to practice patience. The massive bull run your looking for could take another year to happen. Historically parabolic runs after the halving takes place in Q4, in the post-halving year
12
The thing is, btc does not care about the ETFs, nor btc cares about your personal opinion. Tik tok next block. Hold for your own reasons and shh. Also you should not make such spelling errors if you count yourself as an "educated investor".
24
What are you talking about, rapid buy/sell patterns have increased? I don't see that....I have been in bitcoin since 2013, price spikes and dumps have been happening throughout the years.
3
The ETFs effectively act as a layer 2 and remove a lot of the (day-)trading transaction noise from the main chain. Low fees are nice if you actually want to use BTC...Overall, BTC is not a religion. People use it in different ways and that's fine...If you're worried about day traders you seriously need to zoom out.
10
Bitcoin doesn't care what you think about the ETFs..Bitcoin doesn't care about the ETFs...Tick tock, next block.
8
It doesn't matter and was inevitable. Most that are buying ETFs are buying for long-term as well. I bought some myself within my Roth IRA separate from buying Bitcoin. It's a worthwhile product to investors and has its place. Ignore price action and volatility, Bitcoin's always been this and we're on the verge of an interest rate cut and a presidential election So volatility was expected during this time and I don't know that ETFs are necessarily swaying price action significantly more than if they didn't exist

The days of OG HODLERS are gone.  We are a minority.  Accept it and move on. ..We wanted mass adoption, we got it. When the next billion dollar exchange hack happens, some of us will be ok.  ..Grab popcorn.  Let them pump our bags.
2
It is detrimental to investors of the etf that will one day look at their holdings and wish they had the real stuff.
2
Foundationals ?! How about ETFs allowed for buying pressure, retirement transfer, that eclipsed the halving and now there’s a buying pressure drought due to the increased cost of living eating up savings globally?
2
Buy & Chill. ..You're wrong.
2
Etf's were a matter of time. Loads of people want exposure but can't be bothered with self custody etc. Same as investors that want exposure to gold / silver and buy an ETF instead cause they can't be bothered to buy and store physical gold / silver...You can't stop it. Fundamentally btc will win and beat everything in the long run. How long that run is going to take is yet to be seen but so far it's been doing really well...When in doubt, zoom out.
2
Absurd. ETFs are buying and holding.
2
The fundamentals of Bitcoin include minding your own  business. You don't have any say in how other people use Bitcoin.
1
> The rapid buy/sell patterns have increased..That is likely hedge funds trading.
1
The etfs are fine they aren’t how I would go about accumulating but Bitcoin is freedom for anybody who wants it that includes the folks we may see as evil as well and yea some entity’s you hate are going to end up holding a lot of it but it can’t be freedom and lock anybody out at the same time. it’s for everyone
1
One of the most beautiful things about Bitcoin is that the amount that you have in relation to the total cannot be diluted by printing more. When you own bitcoin, you own a fixed fraction of the whole supply of bitcoin. ETF traders own absolutely nothing. ..Focus on your own stack and the best self-custody practices. Ignore the ETF noise.
1
The ETFs are absolutely a net benefit. Idk about the EFTs, though.
1
The ETF's will likely be like fractional reserve banking or the silver market.  It will depress the price by selling more "bitcoin" than they actually have.  Also, I would bet that they will not give you bitcoin in exchange for your ETF purchase, just like the silver market will not give you actual silver when you "buy" on the "market".  ..It's going to be a scam.
1
Oh base principles! Let’s hear these! I’m really curious what you think the base principles of Bitcoin price movements are.
0
Not complaining, just asking about my thoughts.  I am holding. I'm far enough ahead it doesn't really matter to me.  Yet I think it's become a more scary asset for many EFT investors and that was supposed to be somewhat the opposite of when the EFTs were introduced, as I understood it.  It's gained more of a tie to the core market and has less ties to the goal of a deflationary currency.  With the fed chopping rates (soon) and the potential for a recession it seems it should be strong, yet it can't hold critical supports.  Not a detractor, just wondering if it will make sense to me again at some point.
-2
You know what really sucks though? Wait until one of these big holders for ETF coins fucks up and loses access to their own shit. ..You are right though, Bitcoin still won’t care about that, even though a lot of people would.
3
The problem with ETF's is that they will be used to manipulate the price of bitcoin and also to corner the market in Bitcoin.  ETF's will be like the silver "market".  You can buy "silver" on the "silver market" but you cannot demand the silver.  If you do demand the "silver" they will just give you cash instead.  What's more is that they will use investor's money to do the same type of price manipulation, by borrowing BTC on exchanges  (e.g. the government's confiscated bitcoin) and selling it...ETF's basically mean that the bitcoin price will manipulated with investor's money...ETF's were never a good idea.  End user ownership of BTC is far better because there can be no manipulation of the price.

HAHAHA. Correct.

I can't type on a phone well, my apologies and thanks for being kinda of a prick about a question.

I started mining pre ten cents.  It's never been my core hobby, yet it seems that BTC is much more closely following market trends than it used to.  I still see it's core asset as a deflationary currency being one I'd its top qualities, yet I don't think many of the EFT investors actually understand the technicals of the base currency.  Therefore my observation is the trajectory has become more tied to overall FUD and diluted for those who have technical knowledge of the basis.  Not that I'm on a high horse.  I just haven't seen it add much unless you're playing with a whales hand and can take earnings that are worth taking.
-4
Started mining in 2011.  Sold my stash at a few bucks and don't resent it.  Still hold enough that it's fine, yet I am seeing patterns that tie more to macros than to the basis of BTC.

As someone with some invested in ETFs, some in exchange, and some in self-custody; I'm curious what you're thinking will eventually lead ETF investors to wish they had the real stuff? ..Just wondering what I haven't thought of here.

Good points.

This is also what I have held as a core belief.  I'll continue to do so and pass along a legacy.
2
Doh.
1
ETF's will be a net negative.  They will be used to manipulate the price and corner the market.  Uneducated people will think they're buying bitcoin...Look at the silver "market".  You can "buy" "silver" on the "silver market" but if you demand physical delivery, they'll just give you the cash equivalent.  It will be smoke and mirrors, where the coin that they have in reserve will be "borrowed" from exchanges.  ETF's open the door up to manipulation and fraud just like all other commodities and money systems...We should have never been conned into thinking ETF's were a good idea.  Bitcoin will turn into what silver now is... with a fictitious/manipulated price.
1
Bitcoin's deflationary because it has a hard cap of 21 million coins, unlike traditional currencies that can be printed endlessly. This scarcity is intended to boost its value over time. It's also decentralized, secure, and transparent, all recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain. Hope that clears it up for ya.
1
Feds cutting rates is a good future indicator of whats to come, but have in mind that they usually cut for a reason (high or increasing unemployment which worry some investors). The market humbles everyone, hope for the best but plan for the worst😘

Maybe not even cash. Maybe a CBDC or Tether. Those Tether folks are making a lot of friends in high places propping up the bond market.

People have the right to be stupid and naive. Once banks make a mistake people will learn why it matters to hold and truly own your btc/funds. Cause the banks and government won't be able to print btc for the crybabies if that happens.
1
Spot?
1
Every move to and from cold storage is on chain though. It's a common practice to not leave btc on an exchange.
1
It seems you are confused about the difference between "people that talk about bitcoin" and "Bitcoin".
3
1. Bitcoin can be accessed globally, traded 24/7, and can be used as a form of money in some parts of the world.  See btcmap.org
3
3. By owning Bitcoin directly, you can participate in decentralized financial activities, such as staking, lending, or earning yield through various DeFi platforms. These options are only getting better as companies build.
3
2. Bitcoin ETFs are restricted to the financial markets where they are offered and traded only during regular market hours.
2
4. There is more.  Want it?
2
5. Try sending your etf value to someone. Like transferring the shares. Step A, sell share, Step B, wait for money to settle. Step C. transfer from broker acct to bank account, wait for it to settle. Step C.D.Ect.... Btc, very simple. Send value anywhere in the world. Anywhere I say. ..Want more? I got more.
2
I think this is an issue of spot vs. futures.
1
There’s also the issue with MTGOX, high rates, etc etc. ..There’s quite a bit of downward pressure in sentiment and macroeconomics.
1
Bitcoin cannot become a universal means of exchange without incorporation into tradition financial markets. ETFs are one form of that incorporation. ..Everything you are concerned about regarding price action and manipulation already occurs on centralized and decentralized exchanges.
1
Always.
1
Common practice with speculative traders?  No...Common practice with hodlers?  Yes...Hodlers !== Traders
1
It is unfortunately nowhere near common practice to take Bitcoin or crypto off exchanges. 
1
Ok, access. Yes I have been frustrated by the "weekends off" on the ETF side. But for the HODL approach it's less of a problem. But I've considered that in some sort of urgent scenario the accessibility is completely different. Agreed.
2
This one I had not considered. I definitely want to learn about this. Thanks for the pointer in the right direction.
1
I'm always interested in learning, but don't want to burn your time if you think I'll figure it out as I go! But if you're willing, I'm listening.
1
You've given me plenty to think about... Looking forward to it! Good points all of them.
1
I don't disagree about daytraders, but I was mostly referring to a bit longer-scale transactions, e.g. I buy/sell once a week to once a month and always go through cold storage...Anyways, I do think the ETF takes some amount of load off the network, but we'll see whether it's anything substantial once we get to a proper run-up that traditionally causes fee spikes.

Title: Hey hey, waiting to buy on this Septembers dip any recommendations on which approximate week would be the most ideal? 
0
Time in the market always beats timing the market.
25
If we dip below 52k we probably gonna see the 40’s again. If we bounce of 52k we could see 60’s again. My crystal ball is as good as yours I’d say.
11
I suggest you not try to guess the highs and dips. Simply put money there and wait.
10
I would not recommend gambling with your settlement. If you buy Bitcoin and attempt to trade it, you likely will lose. ..I’d recommend buying it for the longterm. Buy Bitcoin and don’t think about selling it until your kids are graduating high school. ..Good luck and congrats on the settlement.
11
12. September 2024 at 16:25 UTC will obviously be the best time to buy
6
I don't have time for guessing this month; I'll just buy at whatever price it is because, all I know, next month is Uptober.
6
Bitcoin is up 63% YoY for the last decade. Those gains happen on average, in under 10 days a year...Time in Bitcoin, not timing Bitcoin. It’s a savings tool, not a shitcoin.
7
Let's ask the Crystal Ball?
5
Bitcoin is a long term savings technology for you and your whole family. If you are concerned about your “much needed money to get lost” then you don’t have a long enough time frame to be saving in it and you will probably paper hand it at any given drop. Not what you want to hear, but nobody here knows what Bitcoin is going to do in the near term(your time frame). ..My advice is listen to some audiobooks when you find time and really build your conviction because without that your kids won’t be receiving any Bitcoin when you’re gone. Just stories about how mom had Bitcoin once and sold it for a nice 50 percent gain in dollars only to lose it back to inflation later. “The Hidden Cost of Money” by Seb Bunney is a great book to check out.
5
I would buy now. Like you said, who knows when that rate cut will happen or when Bitcoin will just suddenly skyrocket for whatever reason. If Bitcoin goes to $250k in a few years who cares if you buy at $57k or $50k as long as you plan on holding. Just make sure to not spend more cash than you’re willing to use. Good luck.
5
Why don’t you consider DCA during each week of September (if buying in September is your preference)?
3
Dont buy bitcoin with money you need. Every drop on the chart will hurt you. Start small and DCA - don’t try to time it, bitcoin is a long term investment so today’s price doesn’t matter..Also happy birthday! 🎊🎉
2
I'm not seeing a lot of upward pressure at this exact moment. I'm hoping for a bit of a dip within the next few weeks,  but prepared that it may not come. I'll probably buy in a week or two or whenever it gets below 55. Under 50 feels moderately unlikely but certainly possible.
2
If tommorow job report is weak, everything is going to drop like a stone.
1
I wouldn't invest my much needed money. If I can cover expenses and I have an emergency fund then I buy. If not, I stay out of it. There isn't a perfect time to buy. You can make an educated guess but you can't be 100%. If you can't afford to lose that money then the best play is to not risk it. It's your choice..It can dip when fed cut rates or it can go up. Or it can go sideways till october... this year, or the next one. .Good luck
1
Easy! You should buy September 9th at 10.22 am - not a minute later. You will have a huge discount - 0,000000001 usd less than the price at 10.23 - don’t fuck it up

Flip a coin.  Any advice here is a guess?

September is one of the worst months for bitcoin historically. Maybe average in over the month

Don’t you ever mention gambling and Bitcoin in one sentence!..I suggest you to buy proper Bitcoin lecture for you birthday first.

This is how reported inflation is only the tip of the iceberg and completely hides the deflation that should naturally be happening for decades. Imagine how much better our lives would be after multiple generations of technological deflation without the overwhelming monetary debasement.

“Improving technology should make things cheaper over time. But Central Banks’ inflation mandates, continually expanding the amount of money, ensure prices increase instead.”..  .Take your time to watch this 34-minute video by Lyn Alden that explains this perfectly (and forward it to anyone you want to help understand!): [https://youtu.be/jk\_HWmmwiAs?si=GZynNP1JJhyTRttA](https://youtu.be/jk_HWmmwiAs?si=GZynNP1JJhyTRttA)

Except technological deflation doesn't occur under conditions of corporate mandated increased profits..Has the relative price of delivery food gone up since now there are hundred of delivery drivers on doordash /uber eats? I think it was cheaper to get delivery food before they came along...Invention of the cotton gin meant everyone got jeans. But that's also cuz all farmers got cotten gins. If we all don't benefit from the technological advancement, then it doesn't lead to deflationary pressure at all. It leads to someone's profits.
2
It is been said before by Milton Friedman and nobody seems to acknowledge such problems. The other problem is money moving way fast than being fulfilled thus central banks has no choice but to levy capital injection to prevent national deficit from occurrence. Alas, national deficit continue to accumulate as presented in US debt clock lol.

Haha yes because the direction/goal is LOWER PRICES ;)

EXACTLY...Ask yourself:..Why is a bread $4 in 2024 and was $0.10 in 1964?..We are probably more efficient in making bread...Shouldn’t bread be a free commodity by now?..Instead, today’s bread is probably worse than 1964’s bread in terms of ingredients and nutritional value.
17
How much better would it be, and why exactly?
2
We would probably be coming out of another depression due to a deflation spiral. ..If your money is going to be worth more in 1 year, you hold off on non-necessary purchases. It will be even cheaper if you wait to buy a house. Now cash is even more scarce in the economy, so the rate of deflation will increase. It also means that saving will earn you value without the risk of investing. This causes a lot of run-on effects that spiral into a crisis.

if you are talking about old items getting more expensive it's because of collection value, nostalgia...Just like old cars, some people grew up wanting one of those amazing cars that only a few could afford, eventually these people got themselves a good job a stable income and decided that it was time to make their younger selves dream come true...The only old items that justifiably get more expensive are jewelry and wine/whisky (up to a point), everything else is collection and nostalgia.

awesome video, thank you, the animations are sick, looking really great.

??
1
This right here ..The "deflation through technological advancement" thesis Bitcoin makes, only works in a world in which corporate profits don't exist or companies aren't interested in profits. ..Generally only huge technological revolutions lead to price drops, general technological advancement only leads to bigger profit margins.
2
Technological advancement is generally a compression of information (or energy) that makes a certain process more efficient. Think book printing, steam engine, telegram, telephone etc...When I was in high school I had to buy a 200$ calculator for my chemistry class, now you can do those calculations for free on your phone...Over time, new technology or innovations become commoditized and accessible to more people.
2
How could bread be free?..There are massive logistics involved in moving and producing the bread. How would that be free? ..Price should lower with efficiency but with something like bread, I’m having a hard time seeing it becoming 100% free...It should have some sort of value to it to maintain the supply chains and efficiency.

It depends on the specific technology but let's say every year on average you can produce 2% more or better goods. Let's say advancements in agriculture mean 2% more or better food every year. The cost of food would be cut in half in 35 years. But because of inflation, the cost is up probably 200% in that same period, which is up 400% from where it would have been with the technological deflation.
3
Iphones get better every year and people keep buying them. Nobody is waiting around for years because something better will be available in the future. People want to enjoy things now. The tendency is the opposite - we are overly impulsive and don't save enough for the future. Changing this a few percent per year would be a good thing.
2
By the same logic people would be buying apple stock instead of buying a house. Apple stock keeps going up right? And yet the reality of course is that that is simply false. People sell apple stock every day.
2
A debt-based system would implode when prices would go down, hence why most people are bending over backwards to cope with the current economy...So that point is right but think about why? Because the entire system is perverse and designed to work against you...The point of people waiting to buy stuff is also wrong. When you are hungry, you buy food. Basic human desires and needs won’t change. They will be different though because they won’t feel like they should spend their earned money as quickly as possible on some trash product from Temu.

If currency goes up in value and the house fell in value is it not still just an equilibrium?...Its not as if the currency gives the house value, its the marginal utility that gives it value.

[effacé]
1
I don’t know, use your imagination?..Like a pill you put into a bowl of water and a bread pops out?..The point of the example is that your are paying MORE currency units for the same (probably worse) product...This happens because those currency units lost in incredible amount of value.
-2
So you make more dollar units per hour now. Are they also more valuable?
2
Not the cause
1
When they announce a new product, sales for the current one will drop. People wait for the new product, or wait for other people to get the new one and sell off their old model for cheaper. ..And increased technological specs isn't the same as the increasing value of money. This isn't some theory, it is the economic reality from history. Deflationary cycles caused depressions ever other decade throughout the 1800s. Since moving off the gold standard to a fiat currency where you can introduce inflationary pressure there have been zero depressions. ..The deflationary spiral doesn't happen all at once. Some will keep buying. But enough won't and will instead save. It happens slowly until it reaches the tipping point where it spirals very fast and it can't be fixed.
1
No, it is like people waiting to buy a house because they expect a downturn in the market. Which is true. There are fluctuations in price and how fast a house sells based on time of year and the state of the economy. ..And in an inflationary market, housing prices have also risen to make them a vehicle for investment. It isn't just stable value verses investing in Apple. You get equity that rises. But in a deflationary market, you end up having to sell for less than you bought it. It is no longer a vehicle for investment.
1
That is why I specified "non-necessary purchases"...Debt-based systems allow for investment and growth that far exceeds where you could go without debt. It's how businesses can grow at all.
1
Because your mortgage stayed constant in value. ..3 years ago you got a mortgage and have $200k left. But now you have to sell for $180k. You are still on the hook for that $20k difference. ..And this deflation can't continue indefinitely. It will eventually cause a market correction. And your money that increased in value will suddenly drop in value. That's good for people with assets, but anyone with cash will suddenly struggle to keep up with groceries and other elastic prices that have suddenly risen with the inflation. ..People will eventually adjust, but there will be people who get hurt in the meantime. Mortgages foreclosed upon, jobs lost, entire businesses shutting down, etc.

Continual LOWER prices. That is the point ⚡️

Efficiency and government are contradictions...Not saying capitalism is any better because it isn’t..Private companies toss away TONS of edible food every day. ..Produce looks weird and won’t sell? Straight to the bin. Premade sandwiches and muffins didn’t sell? Straight to the bin. ..Not sure what the best balance of efficiency and distribution is for staple goods/services but I don’t think a pure capitalist/socialist model is the answer because both have glaring inefficiencies with distribution.

lol, I don’t think you thought it through enough...I’m with you, currency has and will be endlessly debased but the “free bread” theory needs to go back to the drawing board.

That homes are not an investment anymore should be everyone’s goal.
2
You're misunderstanding. You will sell the house for less apple stock than you bought it for. In terms of value, you are losing value compared to if you had just held apple stock, apple stock is appearing as the superior vehicle for investment. Under your logic, no one would buy a house today cause they could just buy apple stock
1
It would make you think about the value of this non-necessary product you would want (to make)
1
[effacé]
1
I'd say those are example of waste due to government regulation, not capitalism. Lots of people would buy day-old sandwiches for half price and business would be happy to recoup costs. There are regulations that force good food to be destroyed.
1
It’s a conceptual example.
-1
I agree there. But deflation doesn't achieve that goal. It means you can just wait for deflation to make your currency worth more and get the house then. If you get a mortgage now, you will end up paying more in payments than if you wait a few months for rates to drop even more.
1
Apple stock isn't a currency. It is a stock. There is a major functional difference between them. You can't buy groceries with apple stock. Currency isn't a vehicle for investment, it is a unit of exchange. ..The value of apple stock isn't to have it, it is for the value in cash it is worth. You can invest in the house and get a return back. Whereas if you invest in apple, you still need to pay rent. So the return of apple minus the cost of rent needs to be higher than the return of the value in the house. It generally is not. No investment provides that kind of value over the long term in a stable or non-risky way. ..All your debt will be the same value in dollars as well. You still have to pay $1000 a month for your mortgage or whatever. But you now have less dollars. So it takes up a larger portion of your budget.
1
Yes. And you hold off on it. Which means the velocity of money in the economy slows. Which causes further deflation. Sales in businesses are down. Which means they need to cut salaries or even lay off people. The financial market does worse, which will affect pensions. There are a lot of bad run-on effects when the economy starts to slow down too much. It is far easier to adjust inflation than it is to adjust deflation, hence why deflation tends to spiral out of control.

Fair enough...Going on the bread example, there are two options: creating a socialist bread, which will probably taste like shit, it’ll be 100% free, production of it will likely cost more money due to bureaucratic bloat...Capitalism will get the price down to the lowest price due to competition, it’ll also taste better to attract more people to buy...I say this as someone who absolutely hates late stage capitalism.

I think youre trying to imply bitcoin could never work because "without inflation people would never spend their resources." my point here is that thats simply false. Youre creating this elaborate web of information thats simply not related to the topic at hand. People buy houses cause when they sleep on the dirt outside they get woken up when the rain hits them on their face. not cause they think alternative investment options couldn't out perform housing...not to mention cause they dont want to be robbed or pooped on by an animal etc. or be cold, freeze to death, etc. people spend money cause they perceive themself as having to, like people will spend money to buy food cause otherwise they'll die of hunger. having bitcoin be deflationary doesnt doom it to some type of "death spiral", thats just a failure to understand human nature and trying to apply some robotic idealistic view that everyone is going to never sell their bitcoin cause theyre looking to optimize their returns to the maximum degree. its simply not based in reality
1
OR we would all focus on only producing and building things that are valuable enough to exist.
2
You're describing a transition from an inflated bubble economy based on malinvestment, to an economy based on real productivity and demand. Of course that transition is painful, as in recessions, but it's healthy. The mistake is creating that bubble economy in the first place. A drug addict goes through painful withdrawal, but the problem is with the drugs, not with getting sober.
1
I agree. Also, we don’t live in a real capitalist society.
1
It's not related to the topic that deflationary economies are bad? That isn't an elaborate web. It is a simple point. ..The binary choice isn't buy a house or sleep on dirt. You can rent as well. Deflationary spirals doesn't mean everyone stops buying. It is small changes that exacerbate the existing deflation, making it worse. Which then causes larger changes which make it even worse. ..There is a long history of it. Deflationary periods in the market are always market crashes that have very negative effects for ordinary people. The Great Depression was the result of a deflationary cycle after the value of the stock market dropped, which slowed the economy and led to the deflation spiral.
1
Is hiring more employees something that doesn't exist? New storefronts or machinery doesn't exist? Product development or expanding into a new market? ..These are all tangible and real things build off of debt. You don't need secondary investment markets to build value off of debt. You need debt to start a brand new enterprise unless you are wealthy.  If only the wealthy can do it, it restricts the new ideas that can improve our lives.
1
I am describing the economy before government debt was commonplace. Pre-20th century, depressions were incredibly common. It is a natural consequence of a fixed value currency like gold standard.
1
Youre sort of getting lost in your own web here. Its simple really, if its ok for apple stock to go up in value, then its ok for bitcoin to go up in value. Suggesting one is wrong is suggesting the other is wrong. Whether any individual wants to treat bitcoin as an investment, or send it to someone else, or to do anything with it, doesnt change that. someone could sell their apple stock for cash then send the cash to someone, it would be effectively the same as sending your bitcoin to someone...if everyone rents, rent goes up, then it becomes increasingly economically logical to obtain a house. and eventually becoming a landlord becomes an attractive way to make money (which you could use to buy more bitcoin)...But you know what, maybe bitcoin isnt for you, and thats ok to be honest. Not everyone is going to be able to understand everything. For example I dont understand modern art.

Title: Exodus Wallet 
13
No. It's not fully open source and full of unnecessary shitcoin code.  ..Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets...A few good wallet choices:..[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial..[https://bluewallet.io](https://bluewallet.io/) \- excellent, easy to use wallet, Open Source and Non-Custodial ..[https://www.sparrowwallet.com](https://www.sparrowwallet.com) - top desktop wallet ..[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets. I prefer the desktop version but it works on mobile too...Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for small amounts):..[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix - very good wallet, uses Tor for extra privacy, easy for anyone new ..[https://blixtwallet.github.io/](https://blixtwallet.github.io/) \- Blixt - great UI, fast and clean ..[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - excellent POS for small business owners as well as integrated Bitrefill or LN Pizza..[https://zeusln.com/](https://zeusln.com/) Zeus - impressive wallet with many features, can even generate Nostr keys..Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):..[Trezor](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're. Use the Bitcoin only firmware as it's safer than a multi coin software. ..[ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/) - air gapped, Bitcoin only, has advanced features but a new user will do fine with one of the great tutorials available...[BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/bitcoin-only/) - another great little device, opt for the more secure Bitcoin ONLY version (less coins = less code = less chance for a hidden bug or a backdoor) ..[Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade) - air gapped, fully open source, Bitcoin only, great features. You can even [build it on your own](https://github.com/Blockstream/jade/), if you feel adventurous. ..[Seedsigner](https://github.com/SeedSigner/seedsigner) - another DIY, fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, not for you if you're just starting up but something to consider later...[Krux wallet](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/) - one more DIY hardware device. Similar to Seedsigner, it's fully open source, air gapped, Bitcoin only hardware wallet, that is not for you right now if you're just starting up, but something to consider at a later stage and/or to up the security of your bitcoin....There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend it as it's not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, recently said they're capable of sending customers' keys out just with a firmware update, etc. **Stay away**, save yourself a headache in the future. ..Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. ..Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. Write them down on any piece of paper as well as the receiving address. Now wipe the wallet and generate a new wallet. If the seed words are different from the first set, you're safe to use it. ..Find an option to set a passphrase and use it. This will boost the security to another level. Never store the seed words and passphrase together. Use a different medium if possible. If somebody finds both, they'll be able to steal your coin. ..This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words and passphrase(s) safe...Welcome to the rabbit hole and don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions anytime during your Bitcoin journey...Also, [check the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/about) that's filled with lots of great info, the [Newcomers FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/s/DQ9IogPw3q), and if you have any questions, visit r/BitcoinBeginners and look for the answers.

I've repeatedly seen posts over the last several years from people who claim their coins were stolen out of Exodus.  Many claim they didn't do anything stupid to enable a breach.  As it is a closed-source wallet, I wouldn't trust it.
1
No, I used it once to claim all my shitty bitcoin forks, and then sold the bitcoin forks for actual bitcoin. Then I never used the wallet again. It does not have a good reputation and is closed source.
1
Yes, been using it since 2017 with no issues.
-2
Awesome reply. Fuck Exodus. 🗑️💩🫏 ⚽️ ..Who remembers the guy in NY who lost multiple BTC using Exodus. Poor bastard. Sad as fuck for him...But y’all come back. Asking the same dumb ass questions. Is my shit hole a good shit hole sir? Why no it’s not and in fact there’s a pinned wiki explaining consensus opinion...Is Exodus a good wallet? You tell me?
4
So green wallet aka blockstream hot wallet is good enough?
1
Wondering what you think of Liana.  Someone was recommending it yesterday for its inheritance-address feature, but I'd never heard of it before.  I'm always wary of newcomers.
1
Then you have learned nothing in 7 years and are placing your coins in unnecessary risk. You should probably stop recommending this terrible piece of software to people.
5
Me too but the Sam from above shared those solid names since I used a few more. Do not keep most or all in any wallets. Move out some from Exodus to opensource proved stuff this if one fail you can still enjoy your dinner.
1
Honestly same.
1
Better than a shitcoin hot wallet, using closed code.
2
Never used it myself, sorry.

Always good to have coins spread out between a few wallets

Title: I need a Bitcoin app that wont freeze my money because i'm a new customer, i need to use the Bitcoin amediatly , and i have a question can i put my Bitcoin from coinbase ona different Wallet or App from a different Provider ? so can i put my Bitcoin in a wallet that isn't the coinbase wallet?
0
Why do you need it immediately? If you are playing someone that only excepts Bitcoin and nothing else, it's a red flag. 
5
Get an electrum wallet on a device without viruses.  Go on social media and find a group where they trade for cash.  Be safe and if you need more help I can tell you how to be safe.
1
If you don't plan on buying great amounts just buy on a popular exchange, withdraw to a mobile wallet like Blue Wallet. Once you have withdrawn to your own wallet it's actually yours, nobody can touch it. And that's the beauty of Bitcoin...Just keep that seedphrase safe!

Relai

Why is it a red flag if i want to use my Bitcoin to buy stuff es zu das possible i don't want to wait to weeks before i can purchased stuff with Bitcoin , would you like to wait to weeks before Amazon i love you too place your order of course i want to use my Bitcoin a medialy der 2 it i can traded i can Salat i can by stuff with it that's what currency is for

[electrum.org](http://electrum.org)
1
Do the have a holding period? And do they have a fee for buying Bitcoin?
2
App?
2
It's a red flag against the company you are purchasing from. Companies that refuse all payments except crypto are 99% of the time a scam company. You need to be careful.
4
You just need to wait for your funds to clear from your financial institution. Once you can withdraw you can get a wallet like exodus and do so
1
never dm anyone or accept a dm from someone regarding bitcoin or crypto, do your own research.
2
Yes, Relai.app ,you make a buy order, send them the money, and they deposit the bitcoin in your own wallet, I've never faced any bullshit from this company before, it's non KYC too, dm me if you need any help.
-1
The only thing i can say i would never recomment coin bas or coin wallet from coinbase the have judged me a lot for this for putting money on the coinbase App i lost 30 € für basically no reason that i cancy and the took about to weeks before i could US my money i know Transport everything i have left touch my Bitcoin without kyc
-2
Don't use Exodus, it's a closed source wallet.
2
Non KYC BY NOW... In less than 2 months they will require KYC
4
If you're simply trying to offload it into your own wallet, you shouldn't have a problem. Please try to work with your autocorrect, is difficult to read your comments.

Sure, but it's still non kyc

Title: Who are some underrated Bitcoin YouTubers/Podcasters/Experts?
19
I have started a podcast 1 year ago. It is called ‘Bitcoin for Millennials’. You can view previous episodes here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD5SRi3OArxPIzRSTEuHIeqDuxdz1yZ9b&si=Ei4sSBHF_wFspzga ..I talk with known Bitcoiners but also tons of more (yet) unknown and normie people that have great perspectives...My latest episode is one of my favorites so far. It’s in the linked playlist above :)..Awesome episodes with new(er) voices like Seb Bunney and Brandon Quittem coming up!
19
bitcoin university on youtube
34
Andreas Antonopoulos. His talks are legendary.
12
Robin Seyr is a younger face on the block.  He is all-in on btc, does some great interviews and is worth a look at.  Underrated and under followed IMO.
5
1. Matt Krater Bitcoin University. .2. Rajat Soni, CFA.3. The Progressive Bitcoiner (if you're tired of the same libertarian take on Bitcoin).
13
For Germans, I can recommend the Blocktrainer and sunnydecree
6
I like TMI/Money Rules ... He's quite candid
6
The English Channel from the Austrian YouTuber Nico Jilch „Fix the Money“. He also has a big German Podcast „Was Bitcoin bringt“ but sometimes he puts out English content:.https://www.fixthemoney.net
3
I find that Erik Krown Crypto is fairly decent, although he does shill his trading indicators on TradingView. I also watch Crypto Zombie as well.
3
Bitcoin university
3
Oliver Velez Is fun to listen to
5
My go to for Crypto/Bitcoin is Jason Pizzino, also does a great job in talking about the overall market environment as a whole which Bitcoin survive on (for now).
2
Peter st onge phd  on twitter. He’s probably on YouTube also etc, and has a website ..Honestly do not remember if it’s ever on bitcoin?  He has a daily clip ( 5 days a week? ) 3.5 minutes long. Excellent economic analysis/ macroeconomics. This goes into bitcoin learning 100%. Definitely excellent content!! He also does have longer interviews at times
2
Tyler S
2
I don’t think he is lesser known, but you haven’t included him here so I must recommend Matthew Kratter, from Bitcoin University. (YouTube)..He puts out a ton of content.
2
Jack Mallers has a podcast it’s pretty solid I listen to it every week
2
Saifedean Ammous, a legend he wrote the Bitcoin Standard book and he has a podcast
2
Invest Answers (James) is it for me. Factual information presented daily, 365 days a year. No fortune telling, just sound data and models. ..While I dolike data, the presenter has to be credible, have good intentions and most importantly, understand the market and its drivers. James ticks all of these boxes. ..He also partners in another show. I think it's called Daily Crypto Analysis (DCA). Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
5
Gday Bitcoin (Sean Clarke) does a good daily live stream covering all headlines
1
If you are interested in long format conversations from a New Zealand / Asia-Pacific perspective but with a global audience check out my show [**The Transformation of Value**](https://www.thetransformationofvalue.com/)**.** ..I've interviewed a range of people about Bitcoin topics from [former Central Bankers](https://www.thetransformationofvalue.com/episodes/reserve-bank-of-new-zealand-inflation-with-don-brash) to [Pro Rugby Football players](https://www.thetransformationofvalue.com/episodes/professional-rugby-and-bitcoin-with-ollie-sapsford)!

I know one from spain, an old wolf with 35yrs being a  trader, he does 2 videos every M-S, pre market and post market, and when something important is going on he posts a middle session video, price action, this guy is amazing but... Is in Spanish... "Bitcoin Hoy" it means Bitcoin Today

War Mode has a great bitcoin episode.

I don't like Gary Cardone he is toxic masculinity meets I will fix bitcoin....There are some neat german ones, not sure if that helps: nico jilch, sunnydecree, blocktrainer. They may have subtitles....British hodl is neat for a middle class perspective....Recently discovered RobynHD. Nice interviews, not sure about him tho, since he is not just bitcoin. Seems like he gets it tho.

Raoul pal is excellent. Not 100% bitcoin per’se. He’s definitely been in this for 10 plus years, been in the financial industry for 30 plus?  He is a macro guy, lots of content, interviews and candid talk. Excellent character!! Definitely worth following!! More important then bitcoin maxi as this emerging class is bigger then btc.

He’s a shit coiner tho

He pumps the shit out of me. I'm ready to sell my house and sleep on the street after 5 minutes of listening to him. Lol...Maybe should do just that.

He sounds bright, but I just can't get over the fact that he doesn't look like he's old enough to drink yet.

The DCA show with that guy CTO LARsson. He has the strongest accent I've ever seen. It's like a character of South Park.
4
Isn’t this the same guy that got dropped from other show after he said the markets were following lunar cycles and other such mystical BS?
1
That guy leans on "like" and "right?" Way too much but he's likeable enough. Seems bright otherwise

Gary really surprised me when I recorded a podcast with him. Very genuine and down to earth guy (definitely compared to this twin). He has a great understanding of Bitcoin. ..https://youtu.be/yktvZQWabeA?si=bWiiwTtqrYYDa3Mv

Didnt know but doesnt suprise me

IDK about his past. But he has nothing to gain here. He is not selling. I do believe his message is relevant.

This sub doesn't tolerate any other coins.

He makes money from engagement
1
He is selling his expertise and is positioning himself as a middle man to people who realistically won't grasp they don't need him any time soon. But I let it slide, since he is doing it for bitcoin
1
Earning money from talking about bitcoin doesnt seem bad
1
Yeah, you are right. But so is almost anyone else of the bitcoiner youtubers.

That's true but the number one rule should be trust no one.. .The big grift will come soon when he has enough followers that he'll start selling some service

BTC to $400k!

Nothing has changed for bitcoin other than the price. The price is influenced by people that do not understand bitcoin (otherwise they would just HODL).  ..Bitcoin is still gonna take over. Price gonna skyrocket to $1 million and beyond eventually, like no question about it. Just use the opportunity to buy cheaper. The amount of bitcoin you own is the only thing that matters. ..Stack and HODL!

So I bought 300$ worth of bitcoin in 2015 on coinbase, completely ignorant to what it was and what I was doing, and I forgot about it, it was a little over 1 coin and I have an email of the transaction completion, but It appears that coinbase shut my account down due to inactivity, but I never got any emails of warnings of closure or anything like that, and I never delete emails..Is there anything I can do? Im still ignorant to bitcoin and the processes, if anyone can help me and I actually find a way to get that 1.257 coins ill kick back some your way. but it appears its gone,..I truly have no idea where to start

The idea has been posted before and was met with downvotes, but we have to face the possibility that 73k was the peak and that the bull run is over..And yes, historically, BTC peaks over a yyear after the halving, but history doesnt always repeat itself: we never had a new ATH before the halving either so anything's possible.

I could see it happening. I hope not, but I can see it. I think people just don't care as much about Bitcoin anymore to be honest, which is why it's trending down. ..I bet all of the popular Bitcoin people (Pomp, YouTubers, etc.) aren't even buying Bitcoin anymore. They're just holding because they got in sub-$10k or probably selling to plebs because they got in early and trying to offload.

Agree. This is just getting depressing. There's no way Bitcoin is getting to six figures by the end of the year.
1
  People just expected so much more this time- even pricing in the halving well in advance of the halving.  Think about if we had chopped at 40K until post halving, mooning to 70K in or around July/August. Everyone would feel optimistic even after a pullback to 55/56K right now, with the opportunity to go higher by EOY. ..It's pretty normal for BTC to have sideways chop for months post halving, usually ATH comes 15-18 months post.  The difference this time is just the wider adoption ETF stuff caused the markets to move prematurely, causing perhaps a bit of unrealistic expectations. ..  .Macro stuff could certainly buck the bulls here, so I'm not going to say I'm as optimistic as I was about 100K by EOY, but I do still feel like the cycle will top 6 figures before we truly enter another bear cycle.

> What wallets even support it?..I wonder the same.  Last time I tried to find out, it was not at all obvious.

>The price is influenced by people that do not understand bitcoin (otherwise they would just HODL). ..I get what you're saying, but that's not exactly accurate. Some people have to sell to pay bills, for example, and the lower the price is the more they have to sell to pay the same bill...Let's consider a mining company for example that needs to sell regularly to cover their operating costs. It would be unrealistic to expext that they only hodl... who would pay for their power costs, municipal taxes, employees, etc?..In the non-commercial realm, consider a long-term hodler who is very much in the green, but has ran out of fiat and needs a cash boost now. Even with the price down from ATH they could be considered to be 'taking profits' as some people say.

Maybe try confirming your identity [here](https://login.coinbase.com/having_trouble) to start?..Help.coinbase.com has several articles that may be useful, but it's hard for me to point you exactly in the right direction without knowing precisely what's going on with your account...For instance, is the account frozen? Locked? Restricted? Closed? Etc. Depending on the circumstances the solution may be different...If all else fails, try calling their main consumer support number at (888) 908-7930...Don't just trust some random number that a stranger on reddit gives you either, verify for yourself by searching that this number does indeed belong to Coinbase to protect yourself from phishing attacks. ..If/when you do get access to your sats, I would highly recommend getting them off the exchange and storing them in a hardware wallet with your backup seed phrase ideally stored in two separate secure locations in case of fire, flood, etc.
1
No, but probably sub 50 again. Maybe 45, depending on macro data coming.  Honestly, it's a damn good buying opportunity.  In 6-8 months people will likely be like "damn wish i would have bought at 50K."..  .Even if we do have a proper recession and it delays the bull market, we could still see a cycle top a year or so from now.

I think we also have to face the possibility that some of us are in here for the long haul and some are in here to make a quick buck...The quick buck pathway doesn't seem to workout for a lot of people in the crypto space, but the long haul path has always worked for the btc crowd...Do I think BTC will be worth more than $56,000 in 2027? Yes,..Do I think BTC will be worth much more than $56,000 in 2030? Yes...The Sats I buy tomorrow (DCA day) will be some of the cheapest Sats I'll probably ever buy.

I am so sick of seeing these posts. ..Bitcoin tracks with liquidity...Rates are high atm. Money supply has been tightening...Wait for the printer. Look at the debt, it's adding 300b/month. They have no other option. No way out. ..Halving is less relevant than ever.

Doesn't really matter for me, I'm not waiting for some peak to dump my Bitcoin for worse money

If you are worried about the ATH of the cycle, you really shouldn’t be invested in Bitcoin. You should invest in Bitcoin because you are going hold it for as long as you can before you need it. Preferably many years.

Yes, but with ease of ETFs, increasing acceptance (as a store of wealth), crypto friendly politicians coming after a myriad of funding, still being valued well less than 1% of global wealth…  I just don’t believe it, not that I don’t think it may take time

This is exactly what a lot of folks forget: it hit the day of halving very close to the previous all time high for the first time ever. Everything is still very much on schedule. Sure, the pressure for business to start to pick up gets higher and higher by the day, but there is very little reason to feel down...For people nervous about the direction: I know it's tough, but treat it like a low maintenance plant. Let it do its thing, every now and then have a look how it's doing and maybe drop some water on it if you feel like it. It'll get where its meant to go eventually whether you stare at it or not. Ignore the engagement farming from people who draw lines on graphs, laugh at the buttcoiners who said Bitcoin is dead when it hit almost hit 3k in early 2019...Even if it doesn't follow the cycle this time, oh well. Hell of a ride. If proper risk management was followed then it's just a decent bet that just didn't pay off this time. Happens. If it wasn't followed, then.. oof ouch owie i guess.

I just find it hard to believe that BTC doesn't get absolutely destroyed in a recession... I think it'll be the first to rebound but it will get smacked down HARD
2
I think this is exactly right. Bitcoin price tracks better with liquidity than with halving. Pay attention to the money supply.
2
Yeah, of course! I'm looking to generate passive income at this point, so selling Bitcoin bit-by-bit is helping me do that, to eventually not have to fully rely on paid employment.
-1
I got in sub-$20k, so I'm (still) okay. ..I still want Bitcoin to do well... I don't know why I'm getting so many downvotes. It's just that I sleep better at night knowing I have passive income from globally-diversified dividend funds rather than holding Bitcoin hoping that the number goes up...What I'm doing: for instance, let's say I have 3 BTC. Over the next 30 years, I would sell 0.0083 BTC every month, and put those proceeds into dividend funds. Just to further diversify my net worth. As you see, I'd still be holding Bitcoin up until 2054 in this hypothetical example.
1
I sell a little bit every month for the next 30-50 years, depending on how I feel. I'm DCAing out of Bitcoin over that time range...I feel relief each time I sell since I'm putting it into safer investments, whether the price went up that month (yes, I'm making more money!!!) or down that month (at least I'm not holding as much as I did before!)

My guess is you may just need to verify your identity with them somehow...My account with them was created around the same time as yours and I believe back in the day you could just create an account more or less anonymously, but somewhere along the line they began requiring more verification in order to comply with new KYC regulations, and I believe those that didn't comply had their accounts locked...So you may just need to take care of that to get back in. The confirmation email that you have should be helpful to prove your case that you did indeed previously have an account with them, and that the account should still have a BTC balance remaining. Just a matter of finding the right page or talking to the right person...As silly as it may sound, one trick that can sometimes be helpful when interacting with huge faceless corporations like this is to email the CEO. This will usually go through to a specialized executive relations team who can escalate your issue directly to the appropriate party with whatever the required privileges may be, and they will typically continue following up until your problem is resolved...In the case of Coinbase, that email is brian@coinbase.com. Try reaching out there if you can't get help through the 800 number ..Most importantly, be persistent and don't give up! Those sats are rightfully yours, don't take no for an answer. Even if this takes you like 3-4 hours to resolve, that's like $15,000/hr for your time, lol...

Sure it would, risk on assets do badly during recessions. We saw this during the pandemic. But then off to ATH a year later. It would soar post recession, unless there is some serious structural change to the economy. If we have a recession this go around, I don't see it being a horrible one, unless some geopolitical event occurs.

60% average annual return isn’t enough passive income for you?

You are getting downvoted for wanting to offload on others as an end goal. While technically true, it comes off as insensitive and offensive to others on this sub that see it as the hardest most valuable asset in the world. And for the majority here, you are missing the point.

Regarded strategy
3
That's past performance. ..I can also say that just because something performed well in the past, it doesn't mean that it will perform well in the future. Have you heard that before? ..Again, I still hope Bitcoin does well, it's just that due to when I got in (I was lucky, I admit), I now want to offload some of my holdings to put it into safer investments that generate a good (5% or more) yield so that I can sleep better at night knowing I'm more diversified and something that's passive income. Again, I can't imagine people buying in at these prices... Bitcoin is not a guaranteed number-go-up technology. If you want to believe that it is, then more power to you.
3
The instantaneous annual rate of return per powerlaw now is about 40%. Still amazing.
1
Okay.
6
That's the whole point... I'm not here for technology, and for the people that say they are, I think they're mostly lying or delusional, or they don't have a high amount of their net worth tied up in Bitcoin. ..If people are being honest with themselves, I'm sure they'd say they just want the number to go up. For people saying they like it when it goes down because "it's on sale", it comes off as a coping strategy in my view.
1
So you want to trade gold for shit, so you can sleep..?try nyquil
1
Shhhh… you can’t say that here.. you are in it for the tech and the financial revolution...If people were honest, they would see that the gap between the perception and the reality of a Bitcoin standard is quite large. If anyone had any critical thinking skills they would see that their hard asset is a biased perception while the reality is it’s a risk on asset that is highly susceptible to general market risk. If you have the means to hodl and find out, great. Only time can prove its resilience and perhaps one day it could be considered a valuable asset.

Bitcoin truly is amazing. ..I do wonder, though how long it will take to educate enough of the masses on bitcoin’s amazing properties and potential as a store of value/ digital currency? Sometimes it seems like a daunting task, especially when you talk to general Redditors online-their lack of knowledge and extreme smugness become gratingly obvious when trying to have a conversation with them about bitcoin...I do know, however, that governments will never become responsible, and they’ll never stop printing/spending money that they don’t have… and bitcoin is the only asset that fixes these problems. There’s nothing else like it. There is no second best. ..I love BTC.

What they mean is that if you take the 10 biggest gain days, you will be left will little growth. It doesn't mean that those days won't be spaced out...THe idea is to not specualte buying and selling, because if you miss just one of these days, you will lose. That is the message.

Man reading you is a pain......Just visit the address and you have the UI there. wtf man.

You have to web into it. It runs headless (i.e., no monitor or keyboard connected to it).
4
Not sure how you installed the Bitcoin app without doing this. ..But from the web browser visit Umbrel.local or 192.168.86.220..That’s how you get to the UI...Or do you mean you have the Pi hooked up to an HDMI cable to a screen? You probably can’t access the UI from there.
3
The spell check just corrected Umbrel to Umbrella… now I really look dumb.   Lol.  But it’s Umbrel.  Not Umbrella… lol.
6
You're accessing it correctly, from the web on another computer. Just leave the Pi connected to power and Ethernet, that's how it's designed, you can only get Terminal access on it directly, so it's working correctly. Now that you have the blockchain downloaded, install the Mempool app so you can see when blocks are being found/transacted, and Blockchain Explorer so you can check your wallet balances privately from your own network.
1
Try username "umbrel" with the password you chose for your user...Don't use your custom username. It is purely cosmetic for the Umbrel UI...It's unnecessarily confusing. This is just one of many, many bad design choices in Umbrel...btw, not sure who needs to hear this, but Umbrel security is *bad* at every level. Never handle funds on an Umbrel system. it's fine for simply running information services like blockchain explorers, but should not be trusted with secrets.

wait for it to crash on you and download the entire blockchain again.

Thanks for the answer … maybe I didn’t set the Pi up properly from the get to… I’ve never been able to get GUI UI on the Pi….(the laptop…. Connected WiFi through a Google mesh router and that is where I “see” the Umbrel Bitcoin node UI through the browser ).  Having said that, I know I downloaded the entire blockchain to the external SSD physically connected to the Pi…. A df on the Pi command line shows I’ve filled up 41% of the SSD attached to the Pi…./dev/sda1  used 746823840…. —- it was bought new, formatted …. So the SSD connected to the pi definitely has  the blockchain….. ). The problem (and I’m starting to think it’s device related ) is that the Pi was, has, and still is, only showing “Umbrel login”.  “Umbrel password” which I’ve literally “logged into successfully” multiple times.  What happens when I do this???? Well I just shows a terminal screen for a few minutes (that’s how I ran the df command and verified that some large amount of data - presumably the blockchain ) has been downloaded…. After a very brief time —- I am “logged out” I guess and get the “Umbrel login” command prompt again?????????    I have no clue.  It almost seems like there is a script or timer or something that just creates the loop.  I cannot get past the “Umbrel login” screen on the Pi… well, I can…. But then without logging out or any action of note on my part…. I am take back to “Umbrel login” on the Pi…. Thanks for the response.

The company of Ricardo Salinas, Mexican billionaire bitcoiner accepts bitcoin. It’s called Elektra and there are a lot all over America. He also owns Banco Azteca and in most cases they are right next to or attached to Elektra. There is a website that says that Banco Azteca is working on a exchange. That would be a absolute game changer is everyone in Mexico at any Banco Azteca people can switch between the Mexican peso and Bitcoin. If this happens, entire central and South America will follow very quickly! A trillion pesos are being send to Mexico in remittances each year. So the fees people are paying are between 10 to 200 billion pesos  per year! .Also Mercado Libre holds Bitcoin? Very big marketplace in Mexico who also have a payment processor company called Mercado Pago. At least here in Chiapas a lot of people are using it. Very very exciting and bullish.

This is correct because all the money is based on debt.  There is absolutely no incentive to pay it back or cut back.  The rich get richer because your savings are taxed thru inflation and their money is on insider stocks.

Because bitcoin is inversely correlated with the dollar index and the dollar crashes, there would be a flight to safety in a currency such as bitcoin that can’t be debased or printed out of thin air.

If usd collapsed we wouldn't price in dollars beacuse nobody fucking wants dollars...I can price bitcoin in anything I want. For example, " 1 Bitcoin is worth 50k Snickers bars." Now, if the whole world suddenly got a virus that made peanuts kill them, then the value of a Snickers bar would collapse over night...Does that mean Bitcoin is now worthless, too? No, I'd start saying, "1 bitcoin is worth 50k Mars bars" instead.

Who says my money is in savings? It's true though, I don't know which stocks will go up.

Have you ever heard of a HYSA? If you by chance had your money in there. Let's say 100k since 2020. You'd have an additional 20k by the end of 5 years (2024/2025) depending on first deposit. ..If you made monthly contributions and saved consistently you could have grown that account by 40+K with 5k per year in savings combined with interest rates. (Tax) That you speak of.. ..I like bitcoin and all but you should really have a good understanding of the American or European financial system as their similar. So I'm not sure where the argument of your dollar goes down when you can easily invest in the S&P and get 8-10% return..Or leave it and let it stack in a HYSA

Yes but bread is not a storage of value. That's a bad comparison. ..When the Venezuela $ collapsed they redirected to the usd till new money was implemented. We can't quite do that. ..It also brings me back round to my original statement. ..Take the bread for example. Prices skyrocketed bc the dollar was worthless. You can say the bread was valued at millions but the millions were worthless...I dont think ppl realise how much rides on the American dollar. It's basicly the unofficial global standard.

Your mixing a means of stored value with currency...They are not the same. Gold is a means to store value. It's not a currency. The Mars bars would be a means of storing value not the value itself.

You don’t. The wealthy do.  That includes your local, state and federal representatives.  Everyone in office becomes a millionaire.  Also yea don’t have a savings account.  Buy gold!

Value will be recalculated in euros, roubles, bric money, gold, silver, crude oil, pebbles or anything we see secondary value...If usd collapses what will he the value of gold? Zero, infinite? We'll very quickly recalculate it to anything more stable
3
So if all usd collapsed, we would price in another fiat. If all fiat collapsed, then bitcoin would be priced in something like gold or oil, or everything could be priced in bitcoin. "1 Mars bar us worth 2k sats"

When the Reichsmark collapsed, stuff was valued in cigarrettes. Yes, you go back to barter when central bank currencies collapse...The cool thing about bitcoin is, it will still be there when the economy recovers from the collapse. Just as gold and real estate.

So I should go homeless is that your wisdom?

Again, most of that is tied to the usd. If the usd collapsed, you don't think it wouldn't affect other currency. The usd is the most used currency for foreign trades worldwide...The dollar and dollar payment system remain overwhelmingly dominant. According to the Bank for International Settlements' latest triennial survey, the dollar as of 2022 was part of 88 percent of all international transactions...Edit...There isn't enough gold to back the usd. That's why we dropped it and the usd is a true fiat. Backed by nothing but the word of our government. If the usd collapsed the world would feel it. We have a gdp of 27 trillion. The largest in the world.
1
The collapse of fiat doesn't make Bitcoin worthless. It makes it more valuable
1
everything could be priced in Satoshis, sure.
1
Gold doesn't back USD because it is impossible to verify holdings cheaply, and moving it in times of crisis is expensive and risky.
2
It could. Not guaranteed. It could also collapse with it.
1
One day, everything will be repriced in Bitcoin.  It takes on average 10 bitcoin to buy California real estate.  Some day in the future, 1 btc will be able to buy California real estate.  All the paper being printed in the world will evolve around btc.  Right now, USD is the best looking horse in the glue factory.

That's not how I understand it. ..Secretary of the Treasury John Connally on the day that President Richard Nixon announced his New Economic Policy, August 15, 1971. (Nixon Presidential Library).Under the Bretton Woods system, the external values of foreign currencies were fixed in relation to the U.S. dollar, whose value was in turn expressed in gold at the congressionally-set price of $35 per ounce. By the 1960s, a surplus of U.S. dollars caused by foreign aid, military spending, and foreign investment threatened this system, as the United States did not have enough gold to cover the volume of dollars in worldwide circulation at the rate of $35 per ounce; as a result, the dollar was overvalued. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson adopted a series of measures to support the dollar and sustain Bretton Woods: foreign investment disincentives; restrictions on foreign lending; efforts to stem the official outflow of dollars; international monetary reform; and cooperation with other countries. Nothing worked. Meanwhile, traders in foreign exchange markets, believing that the dollar’s overvaluation would one day compel the U.S. government to devalue it, proved increasingly inclined to sell dollars. This resulted in periodic runs on the dollar.

Your understand is highly regarded.
1
Retarted? Or regarded..It's history. I thought this was fairly common knowledge. We moved away from gold bc we didn't have enough bc of fixed exchange....https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/nixon-shock#:~:text=By%20the%201960s%2C%20a%20surplus,result%2C%20the%20dollar%20was%20overvalued...Edit. ..This is why you couldn't own gold bullion. Or melt jewelry into bullion. Bc it was fixed exchange rate with not enough gold to back it.
1
You're economically illiterate, and possibly illiterate in general. Your own quote doesn't support what to said: ..> the United States did not have enough gold to cover the volume of dollars in worldwide circulation at the rate of $35 per ounce;..This is not an argument that there was not enough gold to cover US obligations, but that the US did not have enough gold to back it's voluntarily committed dollar liabilities. As soon as the US went back on a gold standard foreign countries and companies immediately exchanged their dollars for gold due to US government spending, draining the gold reserves of the Fed until the government couldn't meet it's gold obligations and unilaterally left the gold standard...There was enough gold, but the USD was not trusted, resulting in the US government to using force of military to back the dollar, hence the forever wars. ..In other words, once the US government was no longer trusted they relied on fear. None of that has anything to do with the deficiencies of gold. Gold is not the global monetary reserve asset because on of the difficulty verifying holdings and moving it around in large volumes during war time when you need to buy allies (think UK government holdings and U-boats in the Atlantic).

>This is not an argument that there was not enough gold to cover US obligations, but that the US did not have enough gold to back it's voluntarily committed dollar liabilities...That means not enough gold to back what's in circulation...>As soon as the US went back on a gold standard foreign countries and companies immediately exchanged their dollars for gold due to US government spending, draining the gold reserves of the Fed until the government couldn't meet it's gold obligations and unilaterally left the gold standard...We never went back. Gold was ditched in 1971. As I stated before. ..>Gold is not the global monetary reserve asset because on of the difficulty verifying holdings and moving it around in large volumes during war time when you need to buy allies (think UK government holdings and U-boats in the Atlantic)...Gold was only ever the monetary reserve asset before 1971 and after 1870. ..Read the link I provided. Plz. We moved away from gold bc it was fixed exchange that could not be floated and there was not enough to cover the usd in global circulation. And since the usd has been the standard for exchange that caused issues. It's still the standard of exchange as roughly 88% of all global exchange is in USD...Edit...To keeps this as simple as I can...Countries simply couldn't bring enough gold to hand to back the amount of debt and currency they needed to move... so they stopped...That means, not enough gold on hand. Countries did not have enough gold ON HAND to settle debts.
1
> That means not enough gold to back what's in circulation...Only because of the fixed exchange rate, which was set by whom?..> We never went back. Gold was ditched in 1971. As I stated before...The US Government went back onto the gold standard in 1944. They left it unilaterally in 1971. They set a fixed exchange rate so that the USD would hold its value, making imports from the rest of the world cheaper. But since the US was the manufacturing powerhouse at the time US products were still in demand, hence demand for dollars. This changed over the decades, and broke in 1971, forever wars ensued.
1
>The US Government went back onto the gold standard in 1944..That was a hot fix of sorts and was not the standard. That was very, very short lived. Leaving the gold standard was not something that could be done overnight. ..>Only because of the fixed exchange rate, which was set by whom?..Doesn't matter, fact is, there was not enough gold on hand. So we ditched it. As I've said before. Not enough gold to back what's in circulation. That's the reason we left the gold. And that standard was set by the globe. 109 countries set that standard of price on the exchange of $35 an ounce. That's when other countries realized they too don't have enough gold on hand to settle debts at that exchange.
1
If the value of gold were set higher the USD would have been devalued and there would have been enough gold. But the gold standard was not verifiable nor easily transmittable in an increasingly digital world so that is why it was not adopted fully. And US didn't want to compete on a fair playing field, as the victors of WW2 they wanted the right to cheat, and the communist world rejected that right, hence the cold war (I do not say that as a proponent of communism, just that communist critiques were not always batshit crazy)...Your analysis is just propaganda, post hoc justification for the political exceptionalism of US statists. Its not rational or credible, anyone with their eyes open who can accept that 2+2=4 can see its just motivated reasoning on your part...Best of luck with your highly regarded beliefs.
1
>If the value of gold were set higher the USD would have been devalued and there would have been enough gold..This is why it was congressionally set with agreement of 109 countries that we had exchange with. ..>And US didn't want to compete on a fair playing field, as the victors of WW2 they wanted the right to cheat, and the communist world rejected that right, hence the cold war (I do not say that as a proponent of communism, just that communist critiques were not always batshit crazy)...That sure sounds like what you knew it implied. Hence the ( ) specificly addressing that. Are you a communist?..>Your analysis is just propaganda, post hoc justification for the political exceptionalism of US statists. Its not rational or credible,..I linked a history based government website. This is not speculation, this is written history. This is all very easily verified in historical documents that have been published. Like the one I linked. ..Again I say, I don't think k anyone realizes just hiw much rides on the usd. It's basicly the global standard of value and should it collapse, the globe will feel it, and it will affect all major currency worldwide. This in turn would affect the value of BTC. Just like when we came off the gold standard It affected global trade. We have the largest GDP in the world. It's 27 trillion. You can't just wipe that out when 88% of all exchange happens through usd...So, I'm guna ask again. If the usd collapsed how would we determine, or place, value on btc. You can't just say it's now worth x amount in x currency. We say that now bc the usd is the global standard of value. Take that away and what happens to BTC?

1
> So it's a verified history by the government...Exactly, so they would write things that put the government in a favourable light rather than the real motivations and decisions behind any given policy.
1
It's not very favorable that the website even admits it's bc the fixed exchange is what caused the limited supply. Believe it or not, the government doesn't always hide its wrongdoings. That's not to say they don't bc they do. But eventually, it always comes out. This has. It also doesn't change the fact. This is verified history. It's very well documented why and when we moved away from the gold standard. ..You're still evading my main question. If the usd is the global standard and it collapses what happens to BTC and how would we place or give value to it. There would be no global standard of value to go by. ..The usd accounts for 88% of all global exchange. That suddenly stops. And you think BTC will do what in response.
1
Only idiots say that USD dominance will stop suddenly. Not the same kind of idiot than the kind that believes limited supply was the reason that gold was a bad global reserve currency in a digital world, but idiots come in lots of different flavours...Newsflash, gold never had to have a fixed exchange rate with USD. If it hadn't then limited supply would not have been an issue. You say that is irrelevant but you don't give a reason, because it's an inconvenient fact that invalidates your argument.
1
>Only idiots say that USD dominance will stop suddenly. Not the same kind of idiot than the kind that believes limited supply was the reason that gold was a bad global reserve currency in a digital world,..We left gold in 1971. That was not a digital tech erra. The pc wasn't even invented yet. Are you smoking crack...>Newsflash, gold never had to have a fixed exchange rate with USD...No, but it did. That's how exchange worked back then. Bc  the dollar wad a fixed value tied to gold and it fluctuated to much to be reliable. It wasn't a fiat yet.  ..>If it hadn't then limited supply would not have been an issue. You say that is irrelevant but you don't give a reason, because it's an inconvenient fact that invalidates your argument...I gave a reason. Over and over and you can't seem to accept it.
1
>That was not a digital tech erra..The USD has been digital in over a hundred years. Any currency that is exclusively governed by a ledger, as opposed to commodity based where the majority of currency in existence is held in barer assets, is digital by definition. You don't need computers to have a digital currency...You just don't understand the subject you're pontificating about...There was a real value of gold relative to USD and it was greater than the fixed rate, otherwise countries would not have drained fort Knox of its gold reserves until the US didn't have enough gold to pay for every dollar it printed...You believe useful fictions because you are a psychologically neotenic statist and US exceptionalist. That is all, your partiality makes you incapable of objectivity and rationality...You cannot stand the idea that you Daddy the state is a broke loser addicted to opioids and stimulants. The US government is a government of cheats and liars and corporate whores. Grow the fuck up.

They didn't use pen and paper ledgers in banks a hundred years ago you daft bugger. Ink and paper, yes. But the vast majority of the currency was simply digits printed on paper in a licensed bank ledger, part of the globally distributed digital ledger, rather than held in bearer assets.

Not only is it a hot wallet but it’s an account that deletes itself if you don’t login once every 12 months...At least the email part deletes itself I don’t know about the rest of Proton...They did say there will eventually be hardware support, they’re just isn’t that at the moment. ..I’ll be looking forward to that feature once it’s available.

Eh, I don't see the point. I use a hardware wallet. I use Sparrow wallet with it, which I love, so I don't see the point in using Proton Wallet then.

Note that this inactivity policy only applies to Free Proton accounts.

They’re supposed to be adding hardware wallet support, but I don’t see any support for it right now.

Oh interesting. I was just going to note that this is currently a hot wallet, so I wouldn't be storing much there.

Those lightning wallets usually require KYC and don’t provide private keys...This is something between Proton Mail users. It’s an add-on to an already existing encrypted email service.

It’s a little early to rub it in his face just yet. It rejected 63,000 in 2021 and proceeded to tank hard the next two years while everyone swore it was going to 100k+ and this year it rejected 73k when once again everyone swore it was moving over 100k+. We’re at 58..now he’s likely dead wrong and movement will happen quickly. But let’s be real, we could see 40k again..30 even over the next year or so. My point is the “you were wrong moment for sure” hasn’t happened yet. Technically it’s anyone’s guess right now. I say show us 100k plus and then relentless torture Peter lol until then..as much as I hate to admit it, he still has ground to walk on.

> Everyone will hate it before they love it.

One thing that always bugged me about him is that he claims to be an Austrian economist but rarely ever mentions any of the founders of that economic school of thought. In fact I have probably listened to hundreds of his podcast and never once has he recommended a single text to read by an Austrian economist. Why isn't he directing his audience to learn the foundation of his own economic understanding? ..The first thing I would do if I had his audience would be to recommend reading "economics in one lesson" by Henry Hazlitt for a general overview then to check out Mises, Hayek and Rothbard if the Austrian school interests you further. ..Of course if you understand the foundation of Peter Schiffs economic thinking then his analysis seems less special and you very quickly identify where he is making arguments that are not part of Austrian economics like when he advocates for supply side economics or claims that a thing ought not be valued due to some economic theory. The very foundation of Austrian economics is subjective value theory, the concept of intrinsic value is debunked by the Austrian school or at least definitions of intrinsic value that are not referencing subjective values as an underlying explanation of value. ..I dont subscribe to Schiff any more either and agree he is not benefitting by predicting bitcoin's demise but maybe he thinks its a good bet in the long run because it is possible that bitcoin will fail and does not hurt his reputation too much by speaking against it.
1
I care because he is extremely detrimental to the world of personal finance and investments, as a whole. I couldn't care less about his BTC take. Granted, that take is emblematic of his poor advice...If you don't call out the shills then you are just as bad as the shills.
1
He is imo one of the biggest morons out there...Buffet doesn't understand bitcoin, but I feel like he actually has the ability to do so...Schiff on the other hand... absolute moron. He is completely oblivious.
1
Gold is still a money today. (By definition money isnt a currency, its just how most people understand it)..Bitcoin is just the first invention to finally beat this asset of its throne. It still has a ~10x to go if gold remains at its current price, but yeah... Itll be fucking inevitable and **I love it**
3
He’s influenced by the Austrian school because of his father but he’s not an actual Austrian economist in that I don’t believe he’s studied Austrian economics in depth to know it’s methodology to the extent a trained Austrian economist knows it. ..He’s pretty good on the basics of economic reasoning but yes the “intrinsic value” thing he uses to defend gold is really bad from an Austrian perspective...I haven’t heard him mention Rothbard or Hazlit in many years but then again I don’t listen to him much anymore...I remember years ago during the housing bubble he had a debate on TV with some guy about the market and the guy brought up the Great Depression and he said “read Murray Rothbard Americans Great Depression” which I thought was cool at the time but this was well over a decade ago.

Come to think of it I have not seen him personally claim to be an Austrian economist, its always someone else claiming he is one. But doing a search specifically about his claims I see that he just claims to be influenced by it and as you say he credits his father for that...I still have a great deal of respect for him despite his rants on bitcoin. The same goes for Nassim Taleb really. Taleb seems to make great arguments regarding the risk of other assets but bitcoin seems to have broken him a little bit.

That is only 3 years ago, don't you remember how you made the seed phrase ? These things are only make with either wallet software or a hardware wallet. You need to get that thing that made your seed phrase, that is a signing device, and you can send your funds to an exchange from that.

Hold onto it unless you really need the money. You will likely look back and kick yourself. ..If you must sell it and presumably don't have a hardware wallet, I'd download the official Blue wallet on the appstore/Google play so that you can spent it.  Either sell it to someone you know or depending where you are, go to a public meetup to sell it P2P. ..I have heard good things about Vexl, an app that matches buyers and sellers. If you're technical there's Bisq, but it sounds like you're not. ..You can of course sign up to an exchange and go through the KYC process to swap it back to fiat.

Try downloading, verifying, and installing Electrum from the official website at electrum.org..It has its own seedphrase system (which predates BIP39) but can also handle the BIP39 standard system.

Just download a wallet like Coinomi. Put in the seed phrase.  Sign up for a legitimate exchange like Coinbase. Using your wallet app sent the funds to the right receiving address provided by the exchange. Sell...Pro tip: Send $1 first before sending the full amount as a test send.

It was open sourced until too many people made lookalikes. The old source code is still available.

I had intentions on doing something with the coins and never got to it, again. They weren’t purchased they were deposited by a client as a form of payment, don’t know why this is so difficult to comprehend.

Hey there! So, you're wondering about the core code that runs the wallet, right? Honestly, it's not the most important thing for most people. I mean, think about it - if you're not a tech wizard, trying to understand the original core source code or JavaScript can be pretty overwhelming! That's why closed source options can be a blessing in disguise. They make it way easier for everyone to use and understand, even if they're not super tech-savvy. Plus, it's worth noting that the original Bitcoin crew used Open Sourced when Bitcoin was still super new and cheap - times have changed, and we need solutions that work for everyone, not just the tech elite!
1
Hey there! I don't care about the "core code" that runs the wallet. I care the current code is available. It's well known it's better to use open source wallets or really for anything privacy/security related. Do you use closed source encryption? I sure hope not.....Obviously you are not very tech savvy but you are in luck... Open source or closed source has no bearing on whether an app is easy to use or not...One still benefits form open source code even if they can't analyze the code themselves because there are others that are and vulnerabilities and issues get reported. I am not trusting something for privacy/security purposes if they are not transparent. Does that mean every line of open source code or every program is audited? No, but zero lines of code for closed source programs can be audited or ever will be.

Title: Calling it now, peak bull run will be mid 2025
634
Thx so much.  A prediction from some rando on Reddit means the world to me
582
Calling it now! I like big butts, I cannot lie !
69
What if it’s 2026? What if we don’t achieve a soft landing due to the precarious unemployment situation? What if liquidity doesn’t show up because of a cost of living crunch affecting retail? Don’t live and die by predictions. The general trend is up, but nobody knows the timeframe
40
So far bitcoin moves in 4 year cycles, with new ATHs arriving around a year after the halving. I guess that’s the basis of your prediction. ..This cycle there was a massive influx cause of the ETF that kind of skewed the chart. But I wouldn’t be surprised if we hit some multiple of 50k (2x, 2.5x, 3x…?) some time next year.
18
It’s a bold strategy cotton, let’s see how it works out
10
Rate cuts will pump markets overall. It’ll provide liquidity. It’s expected… it does not take a genius to figure it out.
24
It will go bull between 2025 mid September to mid October.
6
Whoever disagrees is simply unable to zoom out and mark every halving for the past 12yrs and compare peak prices to the halvings, 2025 going parabolic!
11
For all we know, 73k was the peak and it's passed.
11
One thing people miss is that the mined bitcoin is a lower and lower percentage of daily volume as time goes on. Taking this into account there could be lower impact of progressive halvings.
3
First week of February 2020, we were at 10k. First week of September 2020, we were at 10k. ..The only thing different this cycle is the set point is now pretty much at last cycles ATH.
4
Calling it now, peak is behind us!
8
Why do these posts get so many upvotes when nobody likes them? 
2
I think bitcoins doing pretty good this year. I bought it last August at 26,000 a coin
2
This is the consensus view. Thing about markets is that the consensus view almost never happens.
2
It's been like 5 months since halving..Chill.
2
You are almost certainly wrong, the extended consolidation caused by the early ATH suggests this run will be much longer then previous cycles. The ETFs are now the primary signal while the halving cycle is secondary. They have and will continue to fundamentally alter bitcoins performance. Watch carefully this cycle for things like pension plans and retirement funds allocating as those are long term investments that will further stabilize Bitcoin...Keep in mind what happened to gold after the ETFs got approved, it ran for 7 years.

More like another 2 years to shake out those paper hands 😆 then ATH

Any dumbass can look at the charts and see that peak bullrun should be sometime next year if you adopt any of the theories. Feb-June time frame. The only thing that has to happen for the patterns to be followed is that demand has to stay the same. That’s it. Demand doesn’t have to go up any significant amount, it just has to stay what it is now.

Including those that try to add details about the macroeconomic environment, "this time is different"...there were conditions post halving that could have stopped a bull market each time (and people referencing those things stating the halving cycle is broken now).. Yet each time, the year following the halving is when the parabolic move happens. It's like BTC has sound mathematical principles at its foundation or something.
6
Many peaks are behind us.
13
Then why are you here

Everyone points to the outside factors and why this time it'll be different yet here we are still under $100k with ETF's, still following a similar pattern as before. I personally won't be counting on anything to change.

4
Many wouldn’t because any experienced bitcoiner knows the 4 year cycle would say 2026 is the crypto winter. Some think ETFs have saved us from winters, but except Blackrock having 0 outflows, all other ETFs have clients behaving just like any other investor in Bitcoin. My guess is, we still have crypto winter, unless Larry Fink saves us. Nothing is guaranteed tho. Last week blackrock actually had outflows. So even if Fink is keeping us up by being the only etf provider that doesn’t just go with the flow set by weak hands or diamond hands. ..The true morale here is don’t look for prophets. Look for insight; think for yourself.

At all…
1
The main difference is when people proclaim “calls” for certain prices by certain dates, they’re trying to manifest something in to existence instead of using data to produce a real analysis. Everything I listed are things I’m using to produce my own analysis instead of saying the peak “must be in 2025” just because it’s a post halving year.
2
100x!
3
Why would it crash first
2
Hahahaa, math?…smoke principle? Kidding of course, it will only be different when they wise up and DCA for couple of years instead of waiting for $10k BTC, that boat has sailed long time ago, after 2020 halving.
2
Not here for the peaks...Edit: I'm just kidding around.  I'd be pretty surprised if our peak came at peak interest rates.  ..Also, I definitely am here for the peaks.
2
This time has already been different. The new  high was reached pre-halving.
6
First week of February 2020, we were at 10k. First week of September 2020, we were at 10k...So if everything stays the same as last cycle, we'll all be very happy as we rocket to 300k+.

I mean maybe. Maybe even usualy. But there are some long term patterns that are easier to call than anything from this month to that month. Personally, I'm pretty confident there's gonna be a 2008 level housing market / economy crash in 2026. All the signs have been there for years. Everything's been on track for a crash. Fed's gonna drop interest rates to "save us" and then after a frenzy in 2025 it won't be prop-up-able anymore in 2026. Bitcoin will likely follow the market here like it has in other big broad market swings. At some point it'll turn into a safe haven asset and surprise everyone, but I doubt this will be the moment.

Every cycle people say it will be different when nothing significant has changed. Yet when there is a major change, which has already had an observable impact on price action, they say it'll be the same.

The only thing worth noting. The possibility is there for things to change, but i wouldn't count on the bull run to stretch past 2025. If it does great.

Since when rate cuts signal panic? They are done on purpose.

Rate cuts are needed when the economy needs extra stimulation. The fact that it needs stimulation is kind of a problem and signals the panic. I’m still hopeful we have it all priced in the crypto market but who the hell knows.

Title: Inflation example over 7 years, Europe/Germany
185
Just wanted to share this one I found during a trip to northern Germany. I like these examples, but to be honest I expected a higher increase of the price, only one is above 100%.
36
My pay has not increased that much. And the tipping!
17
Does breakfast get more expensive or is the money loosing its value?
28
Yup true inflation is definitively not the CPI reading … the working class is being robbed every year without knowing 
3
I honestly thought it would be worse. Food inflation in the UK over the last few years has been higher than this.
3
I guess they dont remember weimar
3
In addition you should have have compared the size of the meals. Shrinkflation adds on top of that.
2
I had expected it a lot worse to be honest.
2
Some prices have soared more than 10% per year, and to think that people still believe in an inflation index disclosed by the Government

What? No no...Inflation is only 2% a year. A guy on TV said so!./s

In fairness the alternative world would be deflationary as well so it’d be a greater difference; as it’d be the inflation amount + deflation amount combined in theory that you’re really missing out on in the other paradigm
8
Fuck tipping! McDonald’s has almost 10 billion of profit, almost 50% operating margin!!! And they ask me after I order a burger if I want to make it a meal, then if I want to add something else, then if I’m sure I don’t need to look at the “limited” stuff, then the promo stuff, then they ask if I want to round up the number or add a tip!
12
What's the definition of Inflation?
20
1. If supply of breakfast food goes down, prices go up....2. If demand for breakfast food goes up, prices go up....Expansion of the money supply means the value per currency unit goes down. When faced with inflation, a business can:.* Increase prices.* decrease quality.* lower revenue
4
Yes
2
One is the cause the other the effect
1
Yes, it is the same place
2
I thinking it's showing other way of what inflation looks likes during on daily basis or to go out. People tend not to realise how massive the difference then and now.
5
Oh you mean the official one, where they count the increase of your monitor's pixels as deflation? :D
5
because the data available is usually manipulated. If you want to know the real inflation, save your recipts and compare them in the next year, you will see.
3
Which complete data sets do you mean?
2
money printing, too much taxes

 #1 and #2 if it's bad enough inflation. Is #3 even a real option? 😂
2
Government statistics you can believe in. Or not.
3
if you increase taxes, you increase price of products and services, thus, you create inflation by taxation which is the increase in price due onerousness, and price increase is a symptom of inflation.
2
Taxes increase prices dummy
-3
Less quality and quantity and higher prices! When you push them they say - well, what can we do, we have to survive as a business, ask the banks! Banks say - ask the central bank, it’s not us! Central bank says - ask government and politicians, we just comply with the law! Government says - we do what we can and is necessary for the people, but other countries eat our lunch! It’s all a vicious circle, where the normal man is fucked the most of all.
5
Which independent data source do you recommend for statistics on consumer price index?
2
If you increase taxes, you are effectively taking money out of the economy, thus cooling inflation. As I said, the government spending money it doesnt have and the money printer is a whole other ordeal.
5
It’s called demand pull inflation, I suggest reading up on it before name calling
6
"I only believe in statistics that I doctored myself" - Winston S. Churchill
1
I can do my own and the official CPI numbers are a joke.
1
It's not taken out of the economy. Governments spends it the next day. Taxes are just a redistribution mechanism.
3
sure, but you will drive up the price of goods anyway, which will then take the buy power of people, and since the government wont stop spending anyway, inflation by taxation is real. You increase taxes, prices go up because of taxes, government wont stop spending and printing money = rip. This is what is happening in Brazil.
4
Demand for what? There is no demand, taxes are theft. The government creates and increases taxes to take money from the productive part of society and give it to the unproductive part of society. The increase in taxes increase the price of goods, this alone decreases the purchasing power of the population, people start to buy less goods, companies start to bankrupt because no one is buying anything or they are selling less than what they should be selling.
2
You make no sense and the people upvoting you are economically illerate. Increasing taxes DECREASES demand because of higher prices. The higher prices are BECAUSE of the increased taxes.
1
so what mechanism would you use to enforce the social contract that makes certain concepts like ownership a thing? because I'm pretty sure to some extent that is what taxes are about.  ..i dont think taxes are theft in a vacuum.  but they can be if you have a govt that is not accountable to its tax base in terms of providing the things necessary to underpin the fabric of society...i realize i am not quite arguing the point that you are making (which is about your perceived effect of taxes prices).  but everytime i read taxes are theft, I roll my eyes a bit.
2
>social contract..The idea of a social contract is bullshit, there is no such thing. It's just bullcrap. The market functions based on needs, if there's demand for something, then there is a market for it. Therefore, people will supply this market because they want to make money. The government is not a superhero flying around helping people, it's a bunch of bureaucrats who know little about anything and think they know better than the person risking their own capital to create a company. This individual provides people with something that may or may not succeed, and they could go bankrupt for it. The free market cares about efficiency and demand because company owners don't have unlimited funds if things go wrong, unlike the government, which doesn't prioritize efficiency...If taxes is so good to provide the society, why doesnt people from the government use public health care? Why do they use private? Communism for you, capitalism for me right?
1
What keeps someone from simply stealing the goods/services that you or I produce without the rule of law/the existence of the social contract ?
2
my shotgun, fuck around and find out
1
i mean i guess if you want to start a life or death struggle over the exchange of goods be my guest lmfao ..always sounds cooler/is easier to say, on the internet
1
With or without the "social contract" people still steal stuff from others, or do you live in a country that just because there is police, the crime rate is zero? If so, please say what country.
1
yeah, but in the latter situation, someone will try do something about it...what about other social services?  firefighting for example,  how do you think something like that should be paid for, if not by taxes? what about roads and highways?
1
Roads and highways can be made by the people that needs it, much better and cheaper. In Brazil there was a bridge that fell, the State estimated about 25 millions BRL and many years to make a new one, the local people managed to make a better one for just 7 mil and in a few months because the bridge was needed asap. A fire brigade can also be paid privately, if you want your house to be covered in case of a fire, just pay the local fire brigade monthly to contact them and come, but the best of it is that you could choose the best fire brigade for your money, hell, maybe if you pay insurance for your house, that insurance company may already provide a fire brigade. No need to pay taxes for it.
1
yeah, but what if you dont have a job that allows you to pay for these services? what if you are elderly or disabled and cannot earn an income? should those individuals be left behind in this scenario?
1
everyone should be taking care of their retirement, the job problem is always because of the government that holds the free market back decreasing the job opportunities. No one should be obligated to take care of anyone. If you want to help people in need, do so because u want, but do not force it onto others.
1
I don’t think this makes any sense.  Who takes care of an elderly person with no next of kin, other than social services. What happens if their retirement savings are insufficient for the cost of living/healthcare that they consume...Let them die?
1
their problem, sorry. Again, you should not be obligated to take care of someone you don't know. If you want, go ahead, if I want, then I should not force others to do as well.
1
and if you end up in this situation, you will be okay with it?
1
mind you, i still don't understand how you enforce things like property rights without some sort of government, that has to be funded by something
1
I would accept it, thats why I buy BTC, to secure myself. No one should be expecting a free lunch from anyone.
1
you don't need a government to enforce property rights, because no one has property rights when there is a government. Your house is not yours, the government can take you out anytime, and if you try to defend yourself, you will be killed, and if you don't have weapons, you can't defend yourself, that's why many governments are anti weapons, because armed citizens = more trouble to enforce bad laws.
1
this... feels like some sort of anarcho-capitlist/libertarian nonsense.  maybe you live in a country where the govt doesnt work even a little bit. maybe you should leave...i dont see how no government is better.  If a group of people decide they want to take your shit they just will if theres no govt to enforce property rights.  youre not any better off without one lol. ..you think if a group of individuals want to take your home you are more likely to fight them off because you are armed? lol
1
yup, I'm ancap, but I once was a leftist, but then I started to make my own research. Bitcoin itself is ancap.
1
Just do your own research and see why the government is an evil entity. The government take your chance to defend yourself by taking your guns, do you think the government will help you IN TIME if someone tries to rob you lol?

Came here to say the same haha
1
Running a Bitcoin node enhances your privacy, security, and control by allowing you to verify transactions independently (vs relying on a 3rd party). It supports the network’s decentralization, enforces Bitcoin’s rules, and provides a great learning experience. Plus, you can broadcast your own transactions directly.
3
So I should get out of ledger?
1
>You mean like 90% of the 24,000 full nodes will go away?..those are merely listening full nodes to bootstrap from , when most full nodes are non listening (but still enforce the consensus rules and peer blocks) ..There is around 69k full nodes globally ..http://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/software.html..https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/services.html

IMO, Jade is the best value out there for new Bitcoiners. Its $60, and checks all the right boxes: Open source, Bitcoin only, air gapped, made by Bitcoin nerds..Very easy and straight forward. Nothing to be afraid of. Keep you 12 or 24 words safe and that's really it. Thats all that matters...I just got one but I'm not a beginner and not my first or last wallet...Bitbox02 and ColdCard are also great options
11
Blockstream Jade hands down. $75
7
Trezor✅
8
Tangem
2
I got BitBox and Trezor because they have bitcoin only options. If i buy another one it will be Jade.
2
buy trezor safe 3, its only $80 and provides everything you need. also you can choose between bitcoin only and  normal one that supports thousands of different crypto coins.
2
ColdCard wallet (is Bitcoin only) for $160. Yes, you can mess up but there are plenty of resources out there to help you safely set it up. Securing your Bitcoin so that ONLY YOU can access it is worth learning about.

It cost $150 which is on the pricier side, and im not even sure if it has any advantages over others...Some of the advice I was given was to do a full test with a small amount of your coin. Transfer only a small amount your wallet, test out your seed/recovery phrase (your cold wallet should have some feature to test it), then once you get comfortable with using it, transfer all your coin...Maybe I’ll come back here with an update once I’ve actually done this with my cold wallet.

Foundation Devices is the best user friendly and open source with a great support team roughly $199 and can pay with bitcoin
-1
Safepal X1 only $29.99 with checkout code 13246500@sfp ($40 off!)..I ordered mine just waiting for it to arrive...I will use it solely for Bitcoin.

100% add a passphrase and use it via QR / Air gapped!

Tangem good for beginners but is not bitcoin only and firmware is closed source. But the company is growing and should be a viable pick in the coming years.
1
Not sure why the downvotes
1
You could have used that same money to buy a more reliable cold wallet such as Jade or Cold Card. Don’t trust Ledger. It’s not open sourced and has backdoor accessibly. Not worth the gamble for something as valuable as r/Bitcoin.
3
Don't use Ledger. Worst product on the market.
4
Isn't safepal proprietary?
3
Why only beginners? It’s a great wallet now in my opinion and has been around for years.
1
Tangem keeps the seed phrase out of your control, which people are not accustomed to.
1
really, why ?
0
UI. In app swapping services. But if the goal here is long term cold storage, top priorities should be bitcoin only software, open sourced firmware, and proven audits. I enjoy my Tangem but do not store my bitcoin using Tangem
1
It's not open-source, and it has backdoors where they can extract your seed phrase if they want or are ordered to by government: https://dailycoin.com/ledger-ceo-government-can-subpoena-seed-phrases/..Get something that's bitcoin only and open-source such as Blockstream Jade
5
My Tangem is my cold storage. Trust more than my previous ledger. Perfect wallet, easy to use, UI is way better than Ledger. Dont agree with Bitcoin only, as long as key generation and entropy is good then great for cold storage...Missing some items like multiple receive address but they are coming later this year...Best wallet I’ve had and I’ve used a few. ..My take only, very personal choice in this space what wallet you use.
2
Oh that’s a valid concern. Might be helpful for the OP, maybe I’ll make a switch at some point.
2
I agree. Looking forward to future development of Tangem. ..For my understanding, how is multiple receive addresses beneficial? If I wanted to receive payment from someone, wouldn’t they be able to track that address’s deposit to a main address? What is the main objective of multiple addresses if the blockchain is transparent as to where funds go? I need to read up on UTXO
1
Tons of people use Ledger and have no problem.
2
Can’t track main address without knowing your extended public key. So each recieve would have its own address. It means your total amounts are hard to track across addresses not showing what you hold.
1
Except the people that lost their funds from their Ledger and have no clue how. Well this is most likely how.
1
I just went down a very deep rabbit hole, wondering if I should return it. Somehow I crawled back up and realized I don’t care...I mean like yeah I care.. it’s my money and securing it is important. But this sub will convince you to build an underground bunker to store your seed phrase
0
Any provable examples of this? That it was Ledger’s fault? I know there are security concerns, but I’ve never heard of anyone’s money just disappearing from their wallet without them doing something dumb like storing their seed online.
2
lots of people on here act childish, your ledger is just fine just like mine is perfectly fine.
2
yeah im pretty sure they made that up.. if I lost my coins I would try to blame someone else too
2
agreed, long time ledger users have a right to complain, but a lot of the people just read something in this sub and repeat it anytime they see ledger mentioned
1
So you're saying that when Ledger's CEO literally admitted that they can give your seed to government if required to, he was lying?
1
any company could do the same thing ledger did.. I understand advocating for the use of open source cold wallets. but in a mass adoption future im sure you understand that most people won’t care whether it’s open source or not..
1
Right, so I think we should try to educate people as much as possible

Title: Why Business Bitcoin Adoption Grew by 30% in 1 Year
67
so reading the report, basically the growth is completely from Tether and Microstrategy and your assumption on growth is that they will continuing buying till at least 2026. Your projection does not account for the possibility that those two companies don't purchase any bitcoin going forward or worse yet, sell some of their bitcoin?..Microstrategy lost money $100 million dollars in operations last quarter.  If they continue at that rate they might be forced to sell some of their bitcoin holdings to fund their debt payments and continue operations...As for tether, who knows what they have, do not have, and what their future plans are. Seems like your lower bound on your projection might be a little too rosey.
6
I agree with your analysis. One thing I would like to point out is Saylor has mentioned multiple times that Microstrategy only intends to buy bitcoin and not sell it. And while that has been true so far and his words aren't binding, many companies buy/use Microstrategy stock as a bitcoin proxy since they them selves cannot directly buy them with their excess funds, so if Microstrategy does ever decide to sell it's a loss of confidence for themselves.
4
I see no references to Tether in Sam’s data. 
1
This is not quite what the report writes...- It's not "completely from Tether and MicroStrategy", 85% of the bitcoin purchases by "public" companies is made up by them, but there are substantially more private companies...- The lower bound assumption is that only these two companies will buy at half the rate, ignoring literally every other company that is also buying. So even if MicroStrategy stops buying, the rate would not dip below the lower bound...- Speculating about what Tether has doesn't seem constructive in a report. From an analytical perspective, they have no particular need to sell any bitcoin, and their strategy is clear.
1
Man, when debt comes home to roost.. So many are willing to hodl forever, because why wouldn't you if you just could for the fun of it but that's not how life works, let alone businesses. When your debt is overdue, you have no choice.. Has nothing to do with intention but with your obligations.
6
"Five companies—MicroStrategy, [Block.one](http://Block.one), Tether, BitMEX, and Xapo—hold a total of 559,000 bitcoin, which accounts for 82% of all corporate holdings. MicroStrategy and Tether alone make up 85% of all publicly-reported business bitcoin purchases in the first half of 2024."
2
I mean, ok, but this basic assumption is that none of these companies will sell to the point it offsets the buying of the other companies or to the point it is negative growth. What if the feds come knocking on Tether for enabling money laundering? What if the markets won't lend Microstrategy any more money? What if Coinbase loses its lawsuit with the SEC? What happens if all three of those happen at the same time? Not accounting for that risk is the same thinking in 2008 that a ton of mortgages can't all go bad at the same time!..Also, the fact that ETFs make it easier for companies to hold bitcoin while having increased liquidity and decreased selling costs means that companies investing in bitcoin could go up but holdings of actual bitcoin go down...I get that this "report" is an advertisement for the company, but any projection like this would get you fired from a financial firm. Not saying their projections won't happen but the range of possibilities needs to be a lot greater.

Title: I've been buying and holding since 2015.

Before anyone asks why 10.4 Btc is over a million dollars, OP's portfolio is priced in AUD.

Very impressive. Now, let's see Paul Allen's spreadsheet

You're proof that you can be shit at timing the market and still make money in Bitcoin as long as you hodl.
511
The gram of Molly I've purchased back in 2012 is probably worth at least a million now. On the bright side, it was Dutch Molly and I landed my first FMF experience.
194
Congrats! Youre a 10-coiner and dollar millionaire!
133
Well done. You didn’t time anything but in just 9 years you did what most people can’t do in their lifetime.
58
That’s so impressive
25
Congratulations, 99% of people, even those who knew about btc didn’t accumulate this much and most won’t even get close. I’m one of those people lmao. Good luck OP, this time next year update to make us all happy/jealous again 😂
22
A true DCA example, congrats. Incredible
231
what happened after 2021…?
38
I finally need to figure out how to use excel in the same way. Mine is a little more messy
18
Congratulations for beeing a millionaire!
15
I'm missing something: your spreadsheet says you've spent $48,511.08 but when added up, you've actually spent $70,511.08. While still ahead, I hope you're day job isn't as an accountant! 😜
11
Dad?!?
27
Fking oath kunt, what a ripper! Just shows it’s not timing the market but time in the market that prevails. Good work!
9
I feel weird buying at 60K when i first bought at 4k. Its really hard to buy in at the moment
8
There is no mistaking your persistence here, I think anyone seeing this will be benignly jealous, I wish you well, no money worries in old age for you!
8
Even if it is no DCA, it is how we HODL, well done dude !  ...Few questions for you if you have time to answer :   .Have you sold a bit or not ?  .In 2015, how did you see Bitcoin ?   .Did you know what it was and did you believe in it ?
6
Good man, I see your an Aussie, wish we were mates then. I have been buying since 2016 but not big amounts my wife is in finance she was a tough cookie to crack.

10.4 Bitcoins are not 979k$?..EDIT: Oh, sorry, AUD i see.
7
You know what you are doing. I can already describe you. You don't like showing off, almost no one knows about your btc, you don't chase people's validation, you don't need anyone to tell you the grass is green so you believe in it, you have vision, you see solution more than the problems, youare switched on, and you are great risk calculator and as a result wealthy Bitcoiner. Congrats!
18
I wanna be like you when I grow up (I’m 23)
7
i fucking love this!
6
Hopefully the CEX provide such reporting,  so you do not have to manually track

Now just keep buying and holding for as long as you feel and considering cashing out at 2million pr btc and lambo is on you.
3
Have you never been tempted to shave off a little? Incredible mate!

Big gz looks awesome, I think in 10 years you don't need to work anymore.

That's awesome mate, congratulations!!!

well done mate, well done

You made it bro

I remeber when I wrote a friend back in 2016 saying „yo lets buy bitcoins“. Unfortunately we had no clue how to buy it at that time and therefore only got in the biz 2021. I will never forget this.
3
GG brother GG
3
$96,600 Australian dollars per coin!  That’s nothing!..In Lebanon today bitcoin reached $5,670,000,000 Lebanese Pounds per coin!
3
This example shows why many people are in a similar position to those who are very disciplined in sticking to a DCA strategy. The FOMO buys actually save the day on the long run. As OP started with 100$ purchases, he swiftly went to buying 1k, 3k and 5k lump sums as the price of bitcoin was increasing dramatically and the fomo was rising. It might have looked like terrible entries at the time, but not so much today. If he had decided to just stick to a DCA strategy, he would have probably settled for a quite small purchase, like 100$ a month or even less than that, ending up with a much smaller (even if better performing) investment.
4
Sell 1 Bitcoin at 70.000. Buy yourself a piece of land. ..Just for the peace of mind. Then you'll know you can't lose. And keep on.

Your numbers don’t add up… or am I missing something? But anyways - good job 😎👍

Impressive but $1,000,000 ASD, is $650,310.00 USD so not a dollar millionaire just yet.

The first column doesn't add up properly...  Also 10.4 BTC is less than  979K USD.  Invest some of your money in math or spreadsheet lessons.
2
I'm at 1/10 your value but I started accumulating in 2017. GJ Hodling, if you had friends like me who invested with you, I found Hodling was hard for all of them except me :). Somehow most of them managed to sell for a loss after buying in 2017.

Love this! Good for you :)

That’s awesome man! Go buy a pet kangaroo! Jk. I remember when BTC was only $8/BTC and I was trying to get 10 but at the time I only had my iPhone 4 and couldn’t figure out how to buy it to mess around on the dw. I kick myself for not taking more time and figuring out.
1
this looks very good and worth it though, not sure why dispiline DCA since 2015 surely worth i
1
Sorry could you please clarify for me? You put in 96K in 2015 and now that has become 1M?

BTC is below 64K so you're not calculating your losses.....You bought $70 at $76K you're down not up here...It's just a minor thing but I thought you should be aware.

What a beauty!

OP did you really stop buying in 2021 and haven't bought any BTC in the last three years?

Maybe I’m reading this chart wrong but I’m confused on the price being close to 1 million with only 10.5btc math isn’t adding up for me at the current price of 62k someone able to explain what I’m missing?

Hi OP, loved the clean look of your excel sheet. I’m a beginner and would like to track like you, would you mind sharing a copy of your sheets layout?

Thank you for sharing, this is fantastic. Hopefully the day will come when you don't have to express "profit" in ~~USD~~ AUD. You're not buying back ~~USD~~ AUD anyway. Well done!

This Indian kid in my class told me about bitcoin in 2014 when I was about 16/17 years old. I wish I knew more about it earlier but I’ve been invested since August 2020

I just bought and accumulated a while ago too.  My average cost is all under well under the $1000 mark.  Mostly buys under $600...It was easy to be a Bitcoin millionaire this way.  I buy most of investments with the intention of holding for the medium/long term.  Made 7 figures in fiat too.

Can I ask you something? What will happen when bitcoin supply finishes? The price it reaches that time it’s going to get fixed for ever? For example let’s say, 1 btc = 500k$? So if you have 0.36 you will have 180k$. What is going to be the reason on having btc on that time then?
1
Grats! I made some money too, but I know loads of guys who lost loads. Best practice would be to sell a little bit so you cover your investment so no matter the BTC price you can't loose anymore.

Do you have an easy tool to find out the btc price in USD on a certain timestamp ?

You have turned $50k into $1mm in 9 years by only investing. That is one heck of an investment. Good job on holding throughout.

💎
1
I didn't find my way to BTC until 2017. Wondering - when did the major exchanges actually open for business?
1
Nice. Pity you didn't get in earlier in 2015. The price was taking a pounding then.
1
Congratulations bro,hats of your patience
1
Congrats big millionaire, wish I had been as faithful
1
Wow! Congrats on being ahead of the curve.
1
You sir are a legend.
1
Hodl a little longer. At 5 mil per coin u gonna make it. Everyone will want your coins and you will be ruler of the webs.
1
Bro is either a god or excel master
1
Hackers incoming?
1
Spreadsheet has an error. P/L delta should be the same as your cost, unless im misunderstanding what you’re trying to represent. Might be the AUD/USD part throwing me off...Either way congrats!
1
How was your BTC price at $63k for your last $5k purchase and your current value be $7k?
1
Can you share the excelsheet format?
1
Fuck you. Congrats
1
Do you buy ETFs as well?  I am looking at BITO, IBIT and BITB?
1
Amazing dude
1
Wait how is 10 BTC worth a million?
1
Could we pause more posts like this instead of people mortgaging their homes to buy Bitcoin?
1
You fucking legend
1
That’s awesome man, good for you!!
1
No buys 2022 to present?
1
Nearly a millionaire. Congratulations for the consistency and reaching that hurdle amount :-)
1
Congrats and go fuck yourself 🎉
1
RIP your inbox
1
Congrats.  I'm jelly.
1
Dude. Happy for you but; Opsec. Privacy.
1
Amazing
1
I wouldn't be posting this data online bro
1
Just curious, why no purchases during the 2022 bear market?
1
'Sick cunt'! .Bravo 👏🏾
1
How do you cash this out?
1
My man, congrats
1
Imagine only having to invest $5k 🥲
1
🐳
1
awesome
1
Bitcoin was at 75k??
1
Can I have 5 dollars
1
aghhtevnjgdfb
1
Whoa can I get the format to that spreadsheet please?
1
One day you might sell a big chunk. What's the plan for taxes and what exchange will you use ?
1
congratulations man
1
Very well done!!
1
Hello, it's me, your brother
1
If only the exchange I bought from didn’t go bankrupt :( Crooks are everywhere.  Be careful.
1
Nice but why do you keep waiting until the bulls on. You seem to buy kinda late in each cycle? Intentional?
1
That’s brilliant, well done..Imagine how the 10,000 BTC for 2 pizzas guy is feeling today.
1
10 years to accumulate 10 btc? damn
1
That's the way! ✌🏻
1
75k Bitcoin price?  I missed that on 04/04/2021?
1
Nice spreadsheet, is it automated?
1
That is so awesome!!
1
Congratulations
1
Lol some people are so desperate for attention it’s pathetic
1
So curious why didn’t you $ell during bull runs and rebuy a year after when it crashes?
1
Master
1
Really nice Sir 🤘
1
legend
1
These posts are stupid.
1
That last line is a problem. How did he make a profit when his purchase price was $63524?
1
Patriot and a god me and the rest of the nerds will 🙇‍♂️in your presence once we met you!
1
God bless you and your gain , you deserve it.
1
You sir, are a Legend, Gold Edition
1
Clap
1
😮👍
1
wow
1
My long lost brother...how r u?   ;-)
1
It's weird that the total cost is only 48k. When I roughly add the biggest values I reach 50k pretty quickly so it should be above that number.
1
What’s crazy is he prolly feels stupid for not buying more too
1
How much money r u holding
1
I'm getting sick of all these stupid Flex posts
1
How could u buy at 75k price btc?
1
I will forever kick myself for considering but passing on buying $100 worth at around 2012 for what I think was around five cents-ish. My wife and I were just married and we didn’t have two nickels to rub together let alone one to buy a bitcoin. I torture myself with calculating how much that would’ve added up to today’s prices.
1
so this is a spreadsheet and not a wallet?
1
This is the way.   Hate people who fomo.
1
Beautiful
1
Diamond. Fucking. Hands.

Started in 2017. What a difference 24 months of late realization has meant.
1
Well done sir
1
Congrats on the success of your journey. It's amazing how far 10 years in the BTC market can take someone.
1
Hodl just a couple more years & that million will be 10 million!
1
King
1
ever sold ever?
1
Damn is the $100 still good for buying btc today?
1
Nice
1
Nice work
1
Good job!
1
I would be happy and feel blessed to acquire half that amount of BTC in my lifetime.
1
Now use sovryn zero to buy some real estate
1
Yea, I was about to question that.
1
Put still great profit.
1
Happy for u
1
I took 1 mill and I have 40k now . Thanks to LSPD

I’m jealous

Good for you, pal!

May OP find more success in his future investments
1
Congrats, fuck you.
1
🐐
1
holding since 2019!!!
1
Fake. Can confirm.
1
So you never sold any BTC ever?
1
💎
1
Hey yeah congrats bro!
1
Congratulations man that’s awesome. I’m doing the same but started in 2021. Hodling strong!
1
This bull run is going to anoint a lot of millionaires.
1
How r you going to get 1 MILL out and into an Aust bank account when you’re ready??
1
WTF…This is better than porn… congrats 🙌🏼🤝
1
IDC. Unless you give me sum.
1
I'm copying this spreadsheet right now. Thanks
1
This was the way 💪
1
Good for you! Very cool
1
Let's see what Buttcoin has to say 🤣🤣..(nicely done by the way)
1
Bro how do you cash it out? Or it’s for the excel sheet only?
1
Well done, Diamond Hands!
1
Honeybadger!
1
Well done, sir! I’m a bit envious of your perseverance
1
If only time machines existed
1
Congrats....Whats your exit strategy/timeline?...Personally for me, with bitcoin its to pad/ speed up my retirement timeline....Alt coins will be a case by case basis. Cash out before retirement for fun stuff
1
Yeah well your numbers are bullshit!  Look at the amount of bitcoin and your claimed value
1

Shit send a brother a bitcoin lol

1
And stopped in 2021?
1
09.21 the last?….
1
Now to 100x leverage. Let's go!!
1
Like a real OG .. congrats those 10+ will be 3.5 to 5 million by mid 2025.. Uncle Sam is going to love you when you sell if you’re in the United States
1
You my friend are a genius. Stack Sats, DCA & HODL!
1
Fuck you and congrats
1
I successfully fapped to this.
1
Proof that you can buy the market tops and still have massive gains...Fellow HODLer since July 2015.
1
Stay humble stack sats
1
Holy shit this is terrible OpSec...and a bit crass
1
Good luck liquidating them at a reasonable price
1
Let me get my crowbar.
1
Since 2014 🙈.Sold a bit once to start a year with a clean slate. .Finicial freedom is amazing. .All I do now is wake up head to work as a union Carpenter.
1
It‘s only Fiat Money
1
You can buy at 500k, and if it goes to 1M, you still doubled your money. It’s never too late.
1
I don’t have enough karma to post this as a discussion please help me get 69 up votes...$SKRE inverted leverage on regional banks..Ive been seeing so much big money move. Everyone knows they don’t sell at the bottom. Lets assume something is coming...The fed has come out and said they will be following through with their deal. They are going to stop lending to these banks...$SKRE is inverse leverage on the SPDR S&P regional banking ETF ($KRE)..Let me hear what you’re thinking
1
Someone clear this up for me….why is Chase saying once the “halving” happens price is gonna dip to 42k? Reasoning is supply is cut then difficulty doubles making it unprofitable for miners? Legit or nah?
1
Impressive, now handout 1k.
1
Nice! I see you haven’t bought in 2.5 years. Are you done accumulating?
1
Blessings ✝️

Love it

1
I wanna do that
1
Oh very good 👍🏼
1
Bitcoin, for the rich and will go to zero. Man gambled 50k lol.
1
Show wallet or it didn't happen🤣🤣🤣 most Aussies like to bull shit how they hodled this and that shit..... Not buying into a Randy with a spreadsheet
1
I have a great opportunity for you. If you send me 10 BTC, I'll send you 15 back..I need the 10 BTC first to make sure you're not scamming me.
1
Well done
1
Now you’re up 20% more
1
10 lambos
1
Thank you. I was trying to figure that out.
148
I just thought he was from the future, like Sunday maybe at this pace.
34
OP is now big down under.
11
Ah i thought i bought the wrong btc
9
Thank you for the clarification 🤠
1
Thanks for clarifying.
1
What is AUD?
-7
nah, he is from 2 days in the future
1
Well the first column doesn't add up to 48K... it's much more than that
1
ahhhh I was about to comment this is fake cuz the numbers don't even match haha. Good spot on the AUD!
1
Still don't get the math. Total value 1006k, cost 48.5k, profit 980k?
1
KRIKEY!!! Ty.  This comment saved me

Es increíble todo lo que hicieron y perdieron más

All of Paul Allen's 10,000 BTC have the authentic Satoshi watermark on them.

Best comment of the day on Reddit.
1
Haha such a great response.
-1
So like the Seahawks balance sheet?   Alright
-1
If I didn't have those first few purchases when it was under $1K I'd be in a much worse position...Hodling is really the only way.
325
That's why DCA and hold is the prevailing advice around here. It's the only strategy that works.
14
\* As long as you have a time machine and can buy Bitcoin for sub 5K...OP has acquired only \~1 BTC since the price went over 10k...At current evaluation it's pretty much impossible to get multiple coins unless you already have wealth you're willing to move into Bitcoin or have a high income.
39
lol i thought the same. this man bought all the hypes and paused in between!..nevertheless, solid gains are solid gains and on the path we learn.
5
That's why DCA and hold is the prevailing advice around here. It's the only strategy that works.
2
If you (literally) focus on the number of satoshis increasing not the amount of USD increasing, it becomes easy to HODL. It also makes crashes really fun.
1
Almost priceless.
66
I ordered a lot of that good stuff with BTC. Barely knew what it was back then, just that you needed BTC to buy the goodies. Shame I spent it all on molly LOL.
12
Its hard to see now, but that molly is what helped propel bitcoin to the heights that it is now. People need to USE bitcoin for it to have some value.
30
My molly was definatly not so expensive but also landed me my first and only fmf experience. My gf learned from that experience that she finds pussies disgusting, what a shame 😭
9
You may not have intended it, but that’s a nice reference to Office Space
3
You made the right call
2
lol same the only reason I got into btc
2
FMF?
1
i wish i could give you an award for this
1
dollar millionnaire OR 10-coiner.
23
Screw that. OPs a billionaire in sats/satoshis
1
Dollarydoo millionaire, actually.
1
Impressive he held (ride or die basically) but almost every buy is a FOMO and there's no buys in dips.
4
Same here lol. I started mining back in 2013ish and I try to forget about it all lol. I still am involved in crypto, but man I was young and dumb lol. I bought gift cards back then and spent it. $200 per coin was something else, and I remember when we were thinking “no way this goes to $1k, let along $5k”.
3
I think it's fantastic, but this isn't DCA.  This is a long time and a bit of fomo.  Almost all of the buys are in 2017 and 2021...Great job OP.  You stuck with it.  Well fkn done.  Results speak for themselves.
129
How is this a true daily cost average? He went years without buying and only bought like twice a year in 2015. Isn't DCA where you buy a little each day instead of all at ounce to average your cost out?
2
It's quite clearly lump-sum investing and not DCA. Can you google the terms please. You literally have it backwards.
1
Big drop. Got scared. Held.
103
Exported the report from my exchange and then added in some formulas. It's not too tough.
19
Can you share yours too? I’m looking for inspiration for mine
2
\*In my local AUD currency...But thanks!
25
Hahaha good catch! I haven't edited this sheet in a couple of years and didn't notice that the SUM cell was only adding up to C26, not C30, same for the BTC column. You're the only person to point this out...[Here's the update](https://i.imgur.com/EdCf4rM.jpg)..Can't believe I never noticed that...And no, I am *not* an accountant. Luckily.
17
Yep I noticed this immediately...
0
Instead of buying milk,he bought btc
15
Similar here. But I quickly got over it and kept buying. The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart V2 helps with perspective and future projections.
1
Yep, crack can cost you big time.
2
He seems to have started in his thirties so if you start now you will be way ahead
9
If you just DCA every month, then you don't need to grow up.
1
When your gains are 99x+, you don't really need to track anything.  You just put the whole thing down as capital gains.
6
I know you're kidding, but I wouldn't bother with a Lambo even if I had $50M. Doesn't appeal.
17
Cashed out 10% when it hit US$50K. This is what remains, let's see where it goes.
8
Thats funny because me and my younger friend were in the exact same situation. It was complicated back then. It was not a simple process at all. ..I remember there being whole 2-3 page wall of text guides on how to setup a wallet and all that. It was not "download an app, done" like it is today. This was like 2015 or 2016.
3
Good to be a Lebanese billionaire.
1
I'm in my 40s, my mortgage is 75% paid off. Still half a mil on it. It's a 3 bed apartment...Welcome to Australia.

70k won’t get you land lol
2
He sold some along the way.
1
The Aussie dollar was worth more than the US dollar back in 2013. It might get up there again, let's see how we go!
3
Nah, happy to pay my taxes. Just wish they were spent more wisely...I'll start taking a little bit out every now and then depending on the price. Still plan to hold on to the majority of it for a few years to see where it goes. I've already pulled out more than my original investment.
1
I'm from Australia. It's in AUD.
1
42 Wallaby Way.
3
Where said it’s in USD?
1
It’s way less, (closer to $640k at current prices).
1
The BTC price has gone up since this post.  .  .I put in about AUD$70K between 2015 and 2021. It's now worth just under AUD$1.2M.
1
Good stuff. I would imagine you're sitting very pretty...I've sold about 15% in the last few weeks. Mortage is looking healthy. Nice to see some "real world" results from my magic internet beans...I'll keep hold the rest for another few years though.
1
One of the more popular Australian exchanges...All funds are immediately moved to my hardware wallet. They're never on my exchange account for more than a few minutes.
1
I just got lucky in the beginning. ..Buy it, hold it. Don't panic. Wait.
1
Google Sheet, using a formula to pull the current BTC price...It's just an export of transactions from my exchange. I added columns for the current value (current bitcoin price x BTC amount) and Profit Increase (current value - cost) and Increase (current value/cost expressed as a %)
3
That maths works out.
3
That is not bragging.  That is staying humble and stacking Sats...Bragging would be showing how he got lucky on a meme coin and got $1 million overnight.  That is a long road of blood, sweat, and tears stacking his hard-earned fiat into something he had absolute conviction in.
3
Yeah I fucked that. I've fixed my sheet now :D
1
Prices are in Australian dollars.
1
That was on behalf of a relative. They were annoyed for a couple of years but they've finally seen the truth!
2
PM'd you my seed phrase as proof.
4
"You are only deducting your purchase price, but not the price at which you bought the BTC compared to today’s evaluation."..Both of these are the same, what are you on about
3
Indeed
1
.Jealous Much ????
1
AUD
2
You write funny
1
Never buy more than you can afford to lose. Don't fuck with shitcoins. Approach it with the mentality "I am throwing this money in the trash and I'm ok with that"..Buy it. Hold it. Don't panic when it drops...I've seen it drop more than my annual salary in a single day. That's not a good feeling...  .edit: Don't leave your crypto on an exchange. Ever. Figure out your preferred cold storage method.
8
Don't let uninformed and patronizing people scare you out. Read and research bitcoin. Stay humble.
1
It's all AUD. I just have the US price there for reference.
2
Damn, if I was only young enough to hold for longer.
1
OF has never appealed, so that's an easy one. I'm very happily married.
5
When I've got enough to comfortably retire.
3
Next door to your mum.
3
It's all in Australian dollarydoos.
2
Is this CAD or Aus?
1
I think those first few purchases were in USD, so that US$100 was about AUD$146...And yeah, my wife and I had paid off our first apartment so had a bit of spare cash to risk on investments, hence the big purchases.
1
Yep. Got a big mortgage and all my funds have been going there...The drop scared me good and proper so I decided to be "sensible".
1
Australian dollars
1
Purchased on behalf of a relative who "wanted to get in on this bitcoin thing!" they've been cursing me for nearly 2 years.
3
It's all in Australian dollars.
1
Fear.
3
Yeah, I'm a financial idiot. The only smart thing I did was hold and not sell. ..The old "buy when everyone else is panicking"  is easy enough to say, but very difficult to do...I'm not buying right now.
2
Just did an CSV export from my exchange and added a couple of extra columns.
2
Yeah, someone else spotted that. I commented [here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b2uncq/ive_been_buying_and_holding_since_2015/ksonkxk/)..As I've commented elsewhere - I'm a financial idiot.
3
That's the way. The guy who got me into it had already been into bitcoin for a few years in 2015. I can only imagine how much he's worth.
1
It’s in AUD, and in Australia btc is $96,500 right now
2
that would be silly
1
Correct. If I was to cash out all of this, after tax I'd be lucky to be able to buy a 1 bedroom apartment in one of the major cities.
1
Exported the transactions from my exchange and added extra columns for the calculations.
2
AUD
1
Yeah. Wish I'd thrown $5K at it in 2015 to start with and kept up DCA from then on. I'd be retired now.
1
oh please. OP is literally a nobody.
1
A screenshot of a wallet can be faked a lot easier than this spreadsheet. If I was going to fake it I would have shown smart purchases and DCA instead of a few lucky ones at the beginning and then panic buys during earlier bull runs.
1
Sounds like a good opportunity, send me your address.
1
[effacé]
66
Same here. Thanks
1
If he was from the future he could have helped the Aussies during the great emu war of 1932

Grab a BSV and chuck into an electrumSV while you're at it. May aswell. 😁 Not a troll. I think its wise to do so... personally lool.
1
Australian dollars mate
17
If you open the image fully, you'll see that the scroll bar is only around halfway down the list.
1
Look at that green and offwhite brown coloring.
79
>Hodling is really the only way...Exactly. I tell everyone - it's not too late to buy as long as you hodl for years.
71
I wouldn’t say it’s the only way. But it’s one of a few. ..Like you could have DCA every month for an average price over time, which would do well considering Bitcoin usually has a blow off top and doesn’t stay there for long.
16
No sell 80% and buy 800k of schd and jepi. Take the dividends and keep buying bitcoin.
2
I've only been holding for a couple of years and it's meant that I weathered a huge drop and came out the other side smiling. I'll continue to hold for a few more years.
1
Time in the market is better than timing the market.  Well done
1
So u have stopped buying in 2021?? .Or there is another excel???
1
Time in > timing
1
Clearly.  You bought the hell out of Btc at $55k in 2021 lol
1
Lump sum investing > DCA. ..DCA isn't "keep buying over time". It's "refrain from immediately buying everything immediately"...Buy whatever you can as soon as you can. Buy immediately whatever you can. The longer you wait the higher bitcoin goes and the more expensive BTC becomes. Don't wait. Don't DCA. Buy.
-5
Or just try not to think that you have to have 1 or 10 or more for it to work out well for you. OP and many others around that time likely thought at one point while they were DCAing "how can I ever get to 100 or 500 BTC like the earlier people?"  Ultimately, as long as you hold for a long time, any amount will be significant.
27
Having a whole Bitcoin is meaningless. It's all percentages. The real trick op pulled off was buying a long time ago and holding. You'll probably have similar results if you bought now and hold for 10 years too.. it just takes a whole
9
Yeah, as stated elsewhere I'm an idiot who got lucky.
3
I feel you. I was purchasing sheets and good ol’ mary with Bitcoin back when it was around $250. I feel silly now…
2
Great point, those transactions, while maybe not the best optics for btc and crypto, were vital for proving its use case and that it can work. If no one ever used it would basically be worthless
6
Haha, at least you had the experience, and your GF learned something important too. Imagine if she loved pussies and left you for one.. things could always be worse.
3
Female Male Female threesome
3
He is both, depending on unit of measurement
1
Why not both?  Why not Zoidberg???
1
That's what makes it even more impressive — proof that HODL works even when you buy at the worst time.
3
I have no idea what I'm doing. I'd buy in fits and spurts and purchased big chunks during a bull run. Got scared many times and didn't buy "enough" during the bad times...The only sensible thing I've done is hold...If I'd been DCAing the whole time I'd probably be better off. But I've never been good at finance beyond not buying stupid shit (aside from bitcoin).
93
So buying the top forever is a better strategy than staying in the sidelines.
26
Yeah looking at the dates you’re right, not as consistent as I initially thought.
4
Price dropped and he stopped buying 😂.He only buys when the price is up, not when it’s down. Like a real 🦍He belongs on Wallstreetbets 😜..j/k
68
Why didn’t you buy when it dropped
1
There's no reason to be scared when Saylor and ETFs are buying so much more than this. Do more homework to strengthen your resolve. Your future self will thank you.
-9
Please don't tell me your btc is still on an exchange?
1
Thanks for clarifying. I was already wondering how the fuck you managed to buy btc at $70 000+ lmfao
10
good onya mate, nice one
3
Out of curiosity, what is it that you do do for a living?
1
fyi 6500% of 70k is 4.5 mil so your increase column total row is wrong. ..should be ((total current value / total cost ) -1), or close to 1400%..(*100 for percent but if the column is formatted for percent than it will do that for you)
1
Valid point,  but it helps if your account starts  getting draining incrementally. Granted a bad actor will wipe it clean in one shot .
3
True, me neither :)
5
Lambos are for tossers!
1
You're probably frugal enough that even having a million dollars doesn't appeal. I could probably see you buying land with your BTC, building an earthship and living like a hobbit.
1
Have you considered cashing out 10% again? I'm not sure when something like that would seems like a kind of diversifying...
1
Jesus that’s wild
5
I didn't mean it as a financial advice. Just for the psychological factor. If you take out more than you've invested in total then you can just say, "Fuck it, let it just ride to the moon now. I cannot possibly lose!"
2
That's crazy just shows how volatile fiat can be! Keep stacking those sats! 😀
1
Likely story, what day is it over there right now then hmmmm?
1
Wow that’s awesome! I am new to all of this and just started investing last week on coin spot :)
1
I’m planning on doing same. Admittedly, didn’t sell as much as 15%. Some. But just enough for meeting basics in the moment. Perhaps the prudence in me dictating that.
1
After I saw your sheet, I did mine! Still a long way to go but Im happy Im on it!
1
Please share the formula to pull the current BTC price.  I would find that very useful.
1
Didn’t see it was AUD 🤦‍♂️ sry
1
Absolutely 👍🏻
2
Thanks 👍🏻

Oof.  “More than my annual salary in a single day.”..That would make me so anxious.  Glad you stuck that out...I have $3k worth of crypto since maybe 2017 when I first started.  Have mined, sold, bought, sold many times.  Now i just need to hodl, what I have...And buy… ..Thanks for the tips.
1
Thank you mate, I could imagine all the times I purchased random shit that could have gone into buying btc.. but I think it's a mindset thing now and I get you...do you plan to sell or keep holding? Like how do you take profits (fellow Australian here). ..I'd appreciate tips for Australians
1
I see.  Congratulations on executing your DCA, and on becoming an AUD millionaire.  I think you will be a USD millionaire before too long.

Great!

good on ya cunt

What was the ath for Australia?

That is a really impressive combination of luck and instincts, well done!

at least now they are 20 bucks richer lol. congrats man! wish i had been older but still staking my btc with whatever i can
2
Appreciate the honesty
1
You underestimate yourself.  Knowing enough to hold and not sell is financial genius.  Smarter than anybody on Wall Street.

Still big profit though, congrats 👏👏

well.... so you dont even have that so called easy to fake screenshot

This is me......Got in 2017. A few big purchases twice a year. Than about mid 2020 just every month....Up 600% at time of writing...Dca  gang unite

Actually pretty solid advice. In case, things go south. You got those dividends to fall back on.
0
Schd and Jepi?? What's that?
1
Well you can still DCA over a shorter timeframe, say on a volatile day buying every 15 minutes to catch the average
1
Thank me for my sacrifice 🙃
10
True! :D
1
I dont consider myself a wholecoiner because I once had 100$ in my account while bitcoin was 100$. It is the same thing here. The 10 coins are worth $1M, but to consider them a dollar millionnaire they need to sale.
-3
Dont worry, looks like the same buying pattern as saylor. And you're both doing great!
23
When FOMO hits, don't buy. When you are actually afraid you will lose everything, buy more.
15
I love your spreadsheet dude, congrats! 🙌🙌🙏🏻
8
> I've never been good at finance beyond not buying stupid shit (aside from bitcoin)..No-one has to be good at everything!  Clearly it's sometimes good to specialize.
7
Bitcoin, in its benevolence, has grace for our imperfect decisions. As long as those decisions don’t involve the s word.
3
So it's not just me?!
2
What do you plan on doing with it? We are almost exactly the same. Only difference I see is I bought a car with Bitcoin during the last bull run (a Model Y)
2
But you did the most important thing and that’s not sell.
2
“set it and forget it” is the only way to do DCA properly. You need some kind of auto purchasing on a schedule.
1
Did you secure any profits along the way? I'm asking because a lot the larger purchases (5k) at a time. Is that money you had just saved up or is that some of the profits from the earlier bitcoin bill runs?
1
The funny thing about ATH's is that once you get one after an extended period, it's extremely unlikely that it will just get that new top, and fall back.  I mean like reallly really unlikely.  If you bought at $1300 in 2017, where would you be in less than a year?  If you bought at $20K in 2021, where would you be in less than a year?  This isn't really specific to bitcoin.
1
fwiw, I don't think DCA'ing was really a thing back in 2017. It was really about 2018 that that started happening.  That's the way I remember it anyway. I always considered it my savings account (from 2014) but I wasn't as consistent as I am now. I expect it will be common for most...Now, it's automatic.  Paycheck comes in, % into savings.  That formal DCA really started late 2018 for me.
5
Damn so even if he has the WORST timing, never buys at the bottom, couple thousand here and there, time will beat all that?
23
Thanks for the advice bro.

You’re really telling a dude who has 1 million in BTC how to invest his money. Hindsight 20/20

Yeah, generally frugal. My PC and laptop are from 2020, my car is cheaper 2019 Toyota hatchback, I ride a bike a fair bit, but my bike is from 2016 and was a low-mid tier price...I'm sinking my salary into my mortgage. Living on the land in a hobbit house doesn't appeal. But having my mortgage paid off, a nice big lump sum in the bank/invested, and being able to volunteer or just work part time while travelling a fair amount definitely appeals. ..No interest in a massive house or luxury cars/clothes/most gadgets.
1
I would diversify that 10% into hookers and blow. No sense keeping all your eggs in one basket.
9
I might pull out 5% at various milestones in the future. It'll probably drop again soon. This bull run can't last forever.
5
I've done that already. Fuck it and ride it to the moon is where I'm at.
12
BTC is also a tad volatile!

Congrats, btw! Well done.
1
I'm going to keep holding, I'm expecting it to drop again but I hope I'm wrong. For each 10% it goes up I'm thinking of pulling out 5%...I use CoinSpot. BTC goes from my cold storage to CoinSpot and then my bank account. It doesn't spend more than 20 mins on the exchange.
1
More dumb luck than anything else. I've made purchases during bull runs and held off buying during bear markets. The only thing that has saved me has been holding onto it and not losing my shit and selling during the bear markets.
1
If they'd listened to me back in 2015 that $70 would have been worth closer to $20K. That's on them.
2
Cool so you’ve got active price check formula in the spreadsheet. That’s neat

If you're able / willing to hodl for **years.** Yes, especially before the halving.

That's obviously not what's being talked about here. People are describing periodic lump sum investing based on arbitrary marketing timing attempts as "DCA". It looks really stupid...And I notice I got 6 downvotes by idiots for being completely correct, too.
1
A worthy sacrifice indeed.
1
So if you have property valued at several billion dollars but nothing in your bank account, then you wouldnt be a billionaire? I think tax authorities would disagree with you. OP is a millionaire, or at least so it will say when he submits his taxes, even though he holds the value in assets..Also, if you lived in a country where your income and wealth were measured in bitcoin, and your taxes were paid in bitcoin, then whatever dollars or investments you had would be measured in terms of btc to determine how much btc you should pay in taxes. Conversion rates and prices at the time would be used to measure in terms of btc. In that world, you would be considered a whole coiner (or at least taxed like one) if you had 100 dollars and the price/conversion rate was 100 usd per bitcoin.
3
Always love a good spreadsheet.
7
I was advised to DCA by the guy who got me into Bitcoin. I should have listened to him, but here we are.
12
Coinbase offered automated buying in 2014. It's definitely been a thing
7
This is what people are talking about when they say "Time in the market beats timing the market."

mid 2015 was a bottom and that's where he made the first purchases

1
Well for the first time ever BTC is going mainstream so why sell now?
1
Sure the ASD has 85 years on BTC's price evolution though and USD over 200. BTCs place volatility index has been dropping overtime. The most important aspect is it's supply isn't volatile as it can't be printed out of thin air like fiat or new supplies discovered lake gold.

Yeah, I was never a coinbase person.  Maybe that's it.

Very wise 🧘
1
Hell anyone who bought bitcoin as far back as 2015 was already so far ahead regardless if he bought at the absolute top(at the time).
2
Good advice. Except I'm pretty sure Bitcoin has performed better than everything else in the stock market...Property is so expensive in Australia that I'd only be able to buy a 1 bedroom apartment in a desirable area if I sold it all...Not enough to live on.
6
Nah, I only panic buy during bull runs. Big brain.
2
Got a couple of nice trips planned.

Because paying a chunk off my mortgage is a pretty nice feeling...I've been holding these magic internet beans for nearly 10 years, so seeing some actual real world benefit from them is pretty satisfying.

I get what youre saying but I feel like youre just trying to be a pain in the ass. Typically when you say someone is a dollar millionaire, you refer to the fact that their net worth measured in dollars is more than a million. Being a dollar millionaire is better than being a swedish krone (SEK) millionaire. If you Google «dollar millionaire definition», you will find that I am right and you are wrong.
2
I'd guess he'd own 200+ BTC if not 1000+..Very much a true believer.
1
Yea, I remember ca. 2016 when I was still new to the scene, a colleague was telling me about how he convinced a friend to buy right at the 1k top in 2013. Sounded rough for his friend at the time, but from the perspective of today it was still a great entry point
1
Oh for sure, realise some profits. But with the instos getting involved it legitimises things and this could just be the start.

bought 5k worth at 61k a few days ago and now its immediately dropped a ton a few days later, classic
261
I aint buying that shit now. See ya at 100k

Placing a buy right now
57
This is like Schrodinger buy: if I buy price will go down for sure, if I don't price will go up for sure. Fuck it I just keep my DCA schedule
20
Heck yess finally dropped a bit so i can buy again
118
100000%. I'm waiting for the flood of posts to say I'm waiting for BTC at 35k then I'm buying. FOMO only hits when BTC is rising.
52
I sold a bit around $70K hesitantly but now I am buying..This is a healthy discount.
17
If I buy now at 57, will it go to 52??
16
I always buy at the time when people say it's shit....
31
Damn it, all my dry powder used at 60k...
24
It’s crazy to me that people want it to just blast off to a bagillion dollars now… I genuinely love good buying opportunities, so that when it DOES make higher highs I am in a better position.
9
Maybe I'm a moron, but I just saw this as an opportunity. I feel bad for those that watch to buy and sell over a few thousand dollar back and forth. That seems like it would be exhausting. ..My opinion is that you probably put too much in if you're worried every time the price changes.
18
I’m hoping it crashes hard. My cash is waiting
17
It’s good. Flushes out every fucking moron who is day/short term trading it. 1 BTC = 1BTC. .Dips = Cheap sats to stack.
61
I don't believe in this project and won't buy it until it hits 75k. THAT'S when I'll know it's a legit project.
30
I did!..Sad my DCA was yesterday, but whatever I'll get over it...As for today, I had an amount I was waiting to time the market with (I do a mix of both DCA and dip-buying) and today was the day! Let's see if the fed meeting results (any minute now) do anything with the dip lol.
8
Please stay down until Friday 🤞🏻
8
These are the days that sort the Bitcoiners from the fiat slaves.
36
I am. I'm not missing out this time. LOL and you know what if it all goes to zero so be it.
6
I bought in at 40k and I dont know how to feel
6
Not buying even if it was 10k (I'm super broke).
6
it goes up > oh shit!..it goes down -> oh shit!..I mean, with these sort of nonsense repeating posts - who wants to own reddit's shares?!!..And, these sort of posts are always from those who shit in their pants but want to hide it!
11
Just bought more. The easiest decision of the day.
15
lol - we’re up 100% on the year
5
Shot my full $46.98 wad at the dip.
6
i only buy at the peak
5
Bought this morning. What crash is everyone so concerned about??
4
If it ain't ATH I aint buying!
4
The meme is funny but I think it really helps to understand that the market it constantly taking money away from people that think this way. Its exactly what the market does. If you are just looking for the quick buck the market will move against you and take your money. If you have  strong conviction it makes it so much easier to laugh off any short term move.
7
I'm not buying because I already bought at the exact top :/
8
This sub: “quick, let me put my last $100 in at 70k before it goes to 57k! DCA baby! HODL!”
6
I bought... not a lot, but I bought.
3
I bought more at 60. Longing at 57!!
3
It's all about that DCA!
3
Accumulation Phase
3
DCA on the downward is the only way to win.

Just give me a fucking GBP ETF that I can buy in my ISA
3
In two months at 75k, people will ask if they should buy. Its the circle of btc.
3
Is it too late now
8
What if you buy now and it keeps going down, and down and down
6
Waiting to get paid! Hopefully price will be even lower on Friday.
2
It always happens and it's always kind of funny. Buying BTC above $20k seems crazy to me.
2
if 2020 cycle pattern repeat we go down to 38k and new ATH will be in fall 2025
2
When I saw the at 57K position, I immediately dropped 1K on BTC!!!! It’s time to BUY!!!! We should all be excited. This is the calm before the storm! We are about to see a BTC EXPLOSION 💥
2
Theres going to be hard regret at 114k imho.
2
I bought at $75k but also bought at $4k
2
Keep on Hodl!!!
2
I bought at both prices lol. Doing my part
2
This is actually very interesting to think about because its true. So even if you did buy at 74 youre not selling at 57 but youre also not buying at 57.
2
P.S.  “its a long way to zero”
2
Don’t you guys see the big picture? Read up on Bitcoin. Hold and buy Bitcoiners.. Relax 😎
2
Everyone who buy High needs to wait 4 Year
2
It’s going to 400k next week!!!!! - some guy on Reddit who owns .0002 of a coin bought at 45,000
2
Sure that’s one perspective, another is all the people angry they bought at 71k think it would go up. It’s absolutely possible that this bull cycle is over….
3
That shits still way too expensive, 30k or I’m not buying
2
Lmao
1
All part of the plan
1
What are we buying in at? Need to set my order lol
1
Hahaha yes! Buy it now or STFU in the future
1
For me more like, should I buy now or will it go down even further?
1
Haha I love that the memes just do a 180 and become relevant again 😄
1
Instructions unclear. I just bought 340,000 sats today just the heck of it.
1
Love this meme haha
1
Just bought another $1k.
1
I DCA $10 a day and have 10% of my paycheck direct deposit into cash app for zero fee Bitcoin.
1
What’s the opposite of this meme. Oh shit I bought at 74k oh shit no more dry powder
1
Cheap sats !!!! #DiamondHands 🤲🏽💎
1
Just like stocks you should only be buying on the dips in stages.
1
I want to see some sideways action first, I’m not going to day trade BTC.
1
so glad i didnt but btc at 1 dollar will buy at .00001
1
Always the same
1
Or worse , sell it allllllll !!!!
1
Been buying all the way down. Sold 15% of my stack at $68K, buying back for a cheaper price feels pretty good 😎
1
I’m waiting until it hits rock bottom. Then I’ll buy loads to make up for my losses when it eventually goes back up 🤨
1
I’m glad I bought at 70k, and been buying thinking “okay, it’s gonna rebound now.”
1
Somebody’s big ass buy order is gonna get triggered
1
Of course the time more people buy, it's easier to buy we have the worst halving.  I know it's not over and I know normal people must endure pain to make money but I am shocked it's doing this at this point
1
From the perspective of a risk asset Bitcoin is getting crushed right now. From the perspective of the world’s only certain protection from hyper inflation it’s a great opportunity to add more. Depends on how you see it, and right now a lot of people see it as a risk asset
1
I’m waiting for $22k!
1
Nope I broke my Dax schedule to purchase about $500 worth of btc.
1
I mean we went from 15k to 73k seems like a bull run to me 🤷
1
Do you see it coming down to 49k / 52k ?
1
Will buy when it’s back to 30k
1
Sell all and buy back cheap
1
Well guess I’m not buying a house this year either
1
Yo where’d you get these pictures of me?
1
If you sold ya bitcoin or wished you timed the top to re enter lower. Your finances are not in order.
1
I put some bitcoin in my cart 🛒 at 74k just to see how strong my curse is.
1
We are going lower probably low 40 so do not buy right now
1
Like clockwork every cycle
1
I just bought some.  Get ready for it to go down more.
1
I got in at 37k
1
I sold at $90k CAD and I'm looking to buy back in at $60k
1
Don’t worry all, it always goes back up by the time my payday is here, which is next Thursday
1
I take comfort in the fact that I have no choice. I already put all my money into Crypto and can't buy more...I am very happy that when I needed money to paint the house and put wallpaper up in the living room, I took money out last month.
1
also you can edit this bottom of the picture to 40k
1
Glad we are the 1st of May so I can buy more during this new month. 🤡
1
Let’s go back down to 15k
1
Just buy and forget. Hoping for lower
1
I should have sold and now probably it's gonna sink even more.
1
52k is my strike zone
1
Haha so true
1
Buying this fucker all the way down to February 2024 level!..Who's bitcoin thesis changed in the last few weeks? Why??
1
You guys are the reason I am staying away from buyying from these price levels. Keep on showing how ignorant you are at investing
1
People thought it would sky rocket so they pumped but no that's not how this works so everyone gave up.
1
FOMO means blood in the streets
1
I ain’t buying cause I’m broke 😂
1
Said every retail investor ever
1
Flashbacks from just 2023:..\*That shit will crumble from 30k to 12k\*.."you must be crazy to buy it at 25k".."ZEROOOOOO"
1
bought around 600$ like 4 days ago :(
1
on bro
1
Buying always, never selling.
1
HAHAHA, is funny, becouse is true...
1
Bitcoin is on sale! Buying up all I can afford.
1
62 looked so sweet.
1
Was 17k tested again? It’s the one thing I worry about ?
1
As a Bitcoin believer it is not always a great buy. In fact, Bitcoin is underperforming high beta stocks like Tsla and nvidia. Bitcoin still has some gains ahead but not anything close to the past. The best chance bitcoin has long term is if global fiat currencies explode and fall into hyperinflation. In that world, bitcoin would theoretically be a safe haven assuming it isn’t confiscated or banned by government like gold was in the 1930’s.
1
Not buying anymore digital assets..Letting the ones I already have sit and stake..I’ve grown tired of “chasing the tail”
1
Whats up with the .35% charge just for buying bitcoin tho? Is that just on robinhood or is that all platforms now. They charge .35% to sell it too. Is that to try and keep ppl from day trading too much or what?
1
Always buy after tax season. Lol
1
bought at 65k before the halving, was happy with the 74k, it dropped and guess what, i just took out some of my alt coins that made a profit (or that were dead in the water) and just now bought 57k, even if it drops to 20k i’m still in it for the game
1
Just wait til 49k
1
when it hits 1 million.. the hodlers will ignore us
1
Dont worry about the price just get as much as you can over the next 2 to 3 years
1
Dude I love this meme always makes me laugh!
1
My patrner and I just sold our home and it we'll settle on or before the 27th of May..Then we are dumping that money into Bitcoin...I hope the price keeps going down.
1
bitcoin ath is 10 months after halving. still quite early
1
Bought at higher 10%. Wish I some left to invest now.
1
I bought at 71k and I woke up today... Had to take Advil to clear my headache 😩
1
Already FOMO'd my NW at 73k
1
Just a minor drip. Keep trusting the process! Buy Bitcoin, DCA and Hodl! 🚀💎
1
Bitcoin has been infiltrated. It will always crash to make money disappear
1
Classic BTC experience lol his face on the bottom one kills me 😂😂😂😂💀
1
Me when it was down 27k last year or something thinking it would never get back up again bcs alot that wasnt on this subreddit were saying it would fail.
1
That was my experience with last cycle:  ...BTC at 61k: "omg why didnt we buy at 9k"  .BTC at 20k: "see I told you btc was a scam enjoy bankruptcy!"  .BTC back at 71k: "wow I wish we wouldve bought at 50k"
1
Buy now or regret forever!!!
1
Hahahaha for real
1
  Apparently, the same switch that’s says’ “oh shit!” Is also the same one that makes me smash the buy button.
1
It's completely speculative
1
Number go up 📈?
1
Been DCA'ing $100-$200 daily since the ETF came out. Feeling pretty good. Daily purchases have been closer to $200 since the "dip". It'll probably go to $30k though so you better wait for the bottom /s
1
When it comes to bitcoin, well everyone in the crypto space gets an opportunity at some point to buy it or portion of it.. So its up to you to decide to buy it or just ignore it...The more ignorance and the more you will regret.
1
I'm still happy BTC already made a new ATH
1
https://youtu.be/ANgnautYFNo?si=bM9ojNdlfCit3otH..It's mean but some of you need it
1
This meme never gets old 🤣.Can’t wait for the dollar amount updates in 6 months when it’s back up
1
I love this volatility!  🎆
1
Dad dad BTC is under 60k. Son it's too much volatility....my avg yet is still over 64k
1
Crazy
1
Nice try but I’m still not buying it
1
Eh, I’ll wait to FOMO in @ $100k
1
I bought at 57 yesterday. It’s on sale!
1
Literally me and im not gonna do anything about it
1
Nah waiting for the inevitable drop to 20k once again
1
Now is the time to buy..🙏😃
1
Waiting for 20k
1
Uno reverse card
1
Got my buy orders at 20k
1
I swear, if whenever we go higher I see people go like "should I buy now or wait for a dip", I'm gonna defenestrate myself ..^(Well not really but you see what I mean)
1
still waiting for the real drop. this is nothing. i've been in bitcoin long enough to know to wait for the 50% drops
1
We're $16k Boiz!
1
Why buy at $57 when it will hit $40?
1
This is the situation with some investors in cryptocurrency. They are so indecisive when it comes to when they want to buy. It's always later they will keep regretting it. 
1
Me and my daily DCA chugging along
1
As someone breaking into the market now, I've tried to avoid this feeling by DCA'ing in, but I keep seeing people talking about buying the dip...* To those of you which 'buy the dip' are you only buying during low-points or are you mixing this with DCA?.* If you are mixing these approaches, how do you strike a balance effectively?
1
Wake me up when we get to 20k...or 5mil. Whichever comes first.
1
It’s def going low 50’s
1
You get Bitcoin at the price you deserve.
1
Holding is painful
1
Same story every year
1
Caught 59.5k but it ring matter in 5 years time. Only rational action is accumulation.
1
I think its gonna drop around 47k or even 38k
1
It's always the same.
1
Can’t feel any type of way because I invested at 26k for 75% of my portfolio and 25% was me investing parts of my profit from work and such
1
Who’s got money to buy btc
1
I was farming Bitcoins since 2020.
1
Bought at 45K and been holding since, I’m chilling.
1
I nibbled in the $50k and $60k areas. I know there will be another ATH. But I understand those who fear to pull the trigger at any price. Human nature.
1
LMAO.
1
I posted this same meme in the bear market at 23k
1
Storch rsi still not at the bottom... MACD flipped red... think we might see a little lower yet. DCA is the way :). ..No longs for me, just spot. Let's see if we do hit 52k.
1
40K incoming
1
It is a little bit annoying seeing my balance go down now since BTC is dropping but I ain't selling lol. I'd rather have that then hold GARBAGE fiat which is worthless
1
I held this shit from 68k all the way down to 16k and when I finally get a second chance to sell for a profit it drops from 73k to 57k 😂 I can’t wait to finally get rid of bitcoin. I am done DCAing into this stuff. BTC is literally the only investment that I have that doesn’t make me money. This shits gotta goooo
1
Too real, this is your chance people!!!
1
Your only regret will be you didn't buy more
1
You guys are so boring. Every time, the same memes. I've seen more people post shit like this than I've seen complaining about the price.
1
I’m not buying this crappy price anymore. I already bought it here last cycle...Give me like $80k and might consider buying again.
1
friend sent me a message talking shit about bitcoin, so i bought more
1
!!Flash Sale!!
1
16k please 🤞
1
46K folks
1
Speak for yourself I’ve used this dip to finally get up to .02 BTC!!! It doesn’t sound like a lot but it’s a big milestone for me.
1
Hope it goes to 25k so I can go all in
0
if it goes lower im selling too, just shows the halving means 0, and isnt good to follow waht others say...Use your head, make your own decisions...Im profiting a lot, so dont need the stress and can buy cheaper again, as it it goes below 50k, it will go a lot lower.
0
You do realize it's over most likely, right? Can't believe I invested into this hoping for a bull run...

I was waiting for that meme.

Why is it dropping?
0
Man I just bought $500 worth of Bitcoin at $57K, I hope it doesn't go any lower.. 😏
0
isn’t btc gonna go down to at least 45k? why not wait?
0
Past performance does not predict future performance, especially with macro environment being wildly different from previous halving cycles. ..This is my biggest gripe with crypto pundits. Almost none take into account the larger macro economy. Will BTC still hit $100K? Without a doubt. Will it happen this cycle? Maybe?  ..Once we're back to a low interest rate environment, then I think we will see similar performance to past cycles, but not before. This is uncharted territory not just with Tradfi coming into the space and taking over, but also the high rate environment and us being well into a depression by any other metric. Case in point, all the people wondering where retail is at. Retail is struggling to buy groceries and don't have gobs of cash laying around to sock into BTC like they did previously.
0
I hope it goes lower.  I will simply buy a shitload more.  This shit ain’t going away.
0
What is a halving ANYWAY?!
0
I just want to go down more, way more, so I can afford it. I had to sell some to pay off debts 🥲
0
We all know bitcoin is gonna crash for a while so it makes no sense to get it now
0
I'm buying at 30k.
0
Be patient it’ll be below $20k again

What? I thought it was a store of value. 😂

I finally bought low and sold high this cycle. Only took me three cycles to stop being an idiot.

rug pull baby....this scam market is never going back up lmaooo

Recent ATH was probably the “top” of this bull cycle. The halving, the ETFs were all events we knew were happening and are what pushed the price up. I was also on the hype train and was hoping to sell my sole coin for around £70k. But I’ve changed my opinion massively and I just don’t see any catalysts that can push the price back up to and beyond the ATH so cashed it out at £48k, still 2x’d my money so can’t complain. There will be many like me, and all those that bought the ETFs that will be taking profit and selling before they end up bag holding.
-2
Thank God I bought it at $400-600

sold at 70k :3

Lol the classic Bitcoin experience
239
Short-termism. Only valid if you think Bitcoin will never hit 74k and beyond again.
30
This is what drives the market forward. And in a few years it'll happen again at $100,000. Think of all the people that are kicking themselves for selling when they became disheartened over a downturn in a volatile asset.
17
“I’ll wait for it to go lower”
7
Makes me happy I’m not alone lol
12
Yeah, I dumped 30k cash at 72k. ..But at least I have almost half a coin, I guess.
14
Eh, at least I have some now. Better all in at 70k than not at all.
8
First time in my life almost panic sold. Thought I am much more stable. But fortunately the last braincells reminded me how many people are now selling out of the same panic. And out of that same FOMO they'll buy immediatedly again
2
Bitcoin is like crockpot food, you just gotta set it and forget it. After you've forgotten about it, suddenly your whole home will start to smell like Bitcoin, then you'll know it's time to eat!
1
I decided to short at 57 to balance a little..There very same 1min candle started goin long again and now it's ranging around 57-57500 LOL
0
Same brother, lol. Only going to DCA every two months from now on.
32
Bough 7k at 70k,.Then 1k at 67k.Then 1k at 63k..I guess ill go with 1k at 57k today...
19
DCA. the market always drops after halving as miners and Whales take profit, then they restart the cycle again. These next two months will be accumulation periods until ATH around April 2025
49
Set buy limit orders and break it up. Ive got 12 buys all the way to $45.6k
10
I put in 10K at 68
4
"a ton" lmao
1
You got bogged.
1
Thanks brother. I will DCA after you from now onwards.
1
I did the same, but 10K. Felt like a dip 🤷
1
I did similar, bought about 5k on a total of 2 occasions in the mid to high 60s. But bought my first $500 at 47k! That was before I learned more and wanted in on this asset. I could have bought all 5k at 47k, ugh. But I won’t panic sell so hopefully it should work out ok. 
1
why didn't you sell at 64k at least?
1
Put in 6.5k yesterday around 60k. Woke up this morning and saw a low of around 56k. I was pissed
0
Haha noob ! I'm waiting for the million !
58
72k in 2 months then 57 again. 
12
50 before 100
6
Let’s set buy limit orders at 56.6k, 55.6k, 54.6k all the way down to $45.6k. If it doesn’t go that low, fine. Do a small amount in each maybe $10-100 depending on your fiat. Make sure you’re on a computer for lower fees.
11
BTC 20% off sale! Hurry before the sale is over!
62
Exactly!
1
I’m definitely not buying until 30k I’m not averaging up lol
1
Same here, 25% just to wait for a dip. And lo and behold, its here!
3
Duhhh
6
Bitcoin is not a get rich quick or 50X crypto. (sorry....50X!!!!!). Buy it and hang on to it for 5-10 years. DCA DCA DCA DCA...  .edit: Sorry, didn't assume the ;)
8
48K that's my target.   .NFA.
1
Answer: No, #killerwhales will come in at some random time on a Friday morning when normal people are just waking up and make massive buys (around 47,000 BTC worth) pumping up the price because “they” know anything under $60k is now officially considered “cheap” making the little krill that we are feel like eventual whale poo.
1
Yes but its not the time yet
6
Time to max out credit cards /s
9
But if it holds steady at Xmillion per coin you don’t have to buy more. You don’t have to work. You don’t have to worry about a mortgage. ..Your number might be distant, but other peoples number might have been 70k
7
easier to hit the beholden *1 BTC*
14
1 BTC = 1 BTC 😆 get back to the circus mate

Haha the good oll ‘getting rid of paperhands’ argument. Nice coping.
2
Yeah roses are red and violets are blue, saying meaningless things (like 1 btc=1btc) makes you fucking stupider than doodoo
2
Try a daily DCA, it’s a life saver
1
I could buy so many coins if it went to 0
4
Same. Woke up and the first thing I did was buy $300 worth when I saw the price
12
But down since 2021
6
Similar....<$50 but all I had in hand.

Check out Anders Jensen posts on Etoro. He's a long term BTC trader. He posts target prices every now and then for the long term. You could go hands off by copying his trades through Etoro, or be more involved in your investments and use his post as a guide. Personally, I do both, having a portfolio that copies his trades that I don't touch, and a separate account where I make trades on my own. His last post places 120k this year and 200-250k 2025.
1
Just wondering, what convinced you to buy at that time and not earlier or later? A lot of market manipulators attempt to get other people to buy at a high point so they can sell. I'm curious what to watch out for.
0
Yes
0
I just buy whenever it dips fuck it. I'm in it long term. If Bitcoin was gonna fail I think it would of already. Nobody knows wtf it's going to do. The only thing I know is I don't wanna be on the sidelines in 5 to 10 years again. I would rather be able to say I at least tried. It is what it is. I could be wasting my money drinking,doing drugs or going to the casino. I choose Bitcoin instead.
10
History repeats itself, been there done that. Still over 100X in profit....99X....wait.....92X... tomorrow.....120X
2
If you are a Bitcoin maximalist then you cry and work forever, same as a fiat maximalist. ..I have a more diverse portfolio, stocks, realestate and Bitcoin. If all three fail it’s not likely a planet that’s going to be fun to inhabit.
1
Absolutely. Bitcoin could even have a global maximum price. I doubt it though, seems like something where the value and utility will only increase with time. Might be like gold and stop outpacing every other asset after a time, but I doubt it hits a maximum. No way to know for sure: the best kind of prediction

1
Bru you had a whole ass month to take profits if that was your goal. Missed your second chance now you gotta wait like 3-9 months for chance 3
2
So you bought at the top of a bull run and are going to sell at the early stages of the next bull run. Yeah you should stop investing in anything you don’t understand.
1
Now John. Whaddaya day?
1
Because nobody knows if it will go there no matter how much of an expert they profess to be. One thing I can asure you is that if most people think it’s going to  45k it will DEFINITELY not go there.
1
You won’t go all in if it does. At $25k you’ll say “can’t wait until $15k so I can go all in!”
4
Smart . This isn't something you sit on for years. It hit about 61k in 2021 and now it's in the 50s. That is a loss. Better investments to sit on.

im mad i didnt hodl all the years in the past i had bitcoin cheap. i made money but it was hundreds maybe a few thousand but wouldve been hundreds of thousands. next time bitcoin crashes hard which I think it will, im buying a large amount. Dont get me wrong im buying this dip too but as we know bitcoin doesnt skinny dip, it chunky dunks to pretty low lows.
1
DCA Is easiest on the nerves.
1
You think it will take years to get to 100k?
11
Honest question...not meaning to argue.....Is there ANY business case for Bitcoin to go up? Other than new money flowing into it? It doesn't make or sell anything...  .If it's simply like digital gold, what if China and USA simply say they will not allow any bitcoin traffic to exist on the internet as they roll out their own national digital currencies?
2
True, the only reason I would sell right now is because I want to leverage the money I have in bitcoin right now.
1
40k at 73k 😅😅😅..0.54 bitcoins are mine tho ..Hopefully by the end on year it will all come back
7
I have 1/4th and I bought at 64k it was at 59k but my funds didn’t settle until 8am next morning. Then it went to 66 sold and am currently waiting for the 50k dip. Just didn’t wanna miss if halving took off.
1
the lower it gets you know the more the whales are selling in preparation for the ath. so you should buy their bitcoins away from them

Brave
1
Where can you short a bitcoin?.Can you buy options anywhere?
1
DCA is best done in shorter timeframes, because as you can see, price can swing wildly in 2 months, DCA aims to offset that.
23
Dca'ing is basically trying to time thr market...Just buy when you have the money, don't try and wait until you see a price you like....Ik you've heard this but time in the market always beats timing the market.
1
That is assuming the economy doesnt collapse
15
This 100%
2
EXACTLY!!!! We should all be excited. The great pullback… then EXPLOSION 💥
3
There is no always, there is only what has happened in the limited amount of examples...Your comment is complete speculation. No one can predict with any certainty whether a new ATH is coming again let alone the specific month.
2
That seems like a short cycle? Many predict aug/sept 2025 as ATH period?
1
You honestly think we’re not hitting 74k until apr 2025? That’s wildly low.

Yeah I woke up this morning and snatched 340,000 more sats. Feels good.

Damn, ya'll rich huh 😅
1
Also true
1
Real life DCA and it works.
2
Personally, it was a few weeks before the halving, and YouTubers were predicting 100k within a month, 250k before the year end, and I didn't want to miss out. I get tricked every time! Now I wish I would have waited to put that 10k in.
4
Reddit threads like this one, saying it's "on sale" etc...All bullshit. When it's *really* on sale all the degens are just confused and traumatized...IMO all the people who were loading up on the ETF launch at $42-43k have yet to be adequately punished, and I consider no price above that range to be a sale.
13
It’s still 57k

Same man, it's all or nothing now, I have missed some opportunities in the past ,right now if I lose it all fuck it

true, but im selling all if it goes near 50k or below, all my btc and others...im a gambler but i prefer to exit while im on the top...whales will sell if it goes below 50 and a lot.
1
Hey just sent you some sats. Have you got them?
1
But this is very different, because you know you should be buying bitcoin at 10k, 100k, or 1M.
8
That same type of feeling that happens continuously at the casinos.
1
This is stupid, so when it's 75k you will sell? When are you buying back?
25
I did that 3 years ago. 6k to 8k   then to 4k.  Got sick of seeing my money get cut. Especially by half.  So I did you said.  Sold at 8 and it went to 9.  Kinda panicked.   No way I have that luck.  Bought 1/5 my position at 29k.   Was so upset I only doubled money vs 4 or 5 bagger when it hit 60k and then road it all the way down to 24k for past 4 years!
5
What does DCA means?
1
Prob. sooner, maybe this summer,  but there are no guarantees. But why worry about what happens to a currency based on debt and war if you're in it for the long term?
1
What is the value of any "money" if it can't store the value of your time? As far as govt. prohibitions, when has that ever worked? 🤣
1
I‘m curios, why did you buy at 73k when there was extreme greed?
1
Huh? Whales are selling in prep for ATH? Wouldn’t they be buying for that?
6
just DCA with every 10% drop.  BTC is down over 20% rn this is a golden buy the dip opportunity. Another 10% dip? no problem buy a bit more even if only $100...  .Btc dipping more than 30% in a bull market setting would be rare
1
The first part is plain wrong. People DCA precisely because they would like to *avoid* timing the market. By spreading out your purchases over time, you reduce the impact of market volatility....The second and third part is an endorsement for DCA’ing...Bitcoin is one of the most volatile assets in the world. The market can often stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, leading to paper hands. Of course, 74k is just the beginning, but if the past is any indication of the future, it’ll be a wild ride with a lot of shakeouts. ..Remember folks: Peace of mind is key. DCA’ing is a great disciplinary tool for any passive investor, helping us stay committed to our investment strategy regardless of short term market movements.
1
Don't worry....money printing will keep it all afloat like it has for the past 50 years. Inflation is gonna suck for alot of people in a couple years
13
Why would the economy collapse at this stage?..The Fed literally came out 10 minutes ago saying that the economy is so strong, they are keeping the rates at 5.5% for the foreseeable future...The Fed wouldn't do stuff like that if the economy were at the brink of collapse. Simple way to gauge is to just go downtown on a Friday/Saturday night. Restaurants, theaters, concerts, still packed with people, menu prices are higher than ever.
13
If the economy collapses I'm raising my targets
1
Lol
1
Hopefully sooner than October (6 months after halving) cause of ETFs and hype.
1
It's done it 3x already. I'm pretty certain it will follow historical patterns. It could be more exaggerated or shorter this time though cause economy, ETFs, BLACKROCK!!
0
I'm predicting a shorter cycle mainly cause of the current state of the economy. ATH could be hit in April then a drop then another lower high with the cycle ending around October 2025. This cycle has been behaving differently cause of ETFs. We hit ATH before halving. I have a gut feeling it might be shorter. ..Let's see how it plays out as it's all probability at the end of the day
1
Hoping for the best. Going to put in another 14k but waiting for the right moment

Extra steps

A lot of exchanges have lower fees on the desktop version of the website.

True, it's not a popular opinion, but I'm sure some people make money doing the opposite of what r/bitcoin says.

Very smart. Take the profit. Others will sit on this as it goes up and down and make very little. Im a big microstrategy holder. I was way up now and sold half and now hoping it can rebound but btc is basically down every day. Big firms are forecasting a big drop still. Of course people on here are forecasting 100k. The big guys I would trust.  Lets hope we see a green day eventually. This is just brutal

No unfortunately not 😩

Lmao @ this being downvoted in r/bitcoin. Guess the degen get rich quick noobs are here once again.

You also know you must wait/hold 10 years at least

If you manage to set your Limit order when its down 15%-20% since ATH, you will likely win based on history. No one knows about the future, but history showed it happens often...But I was also one of the stupid ones that refilled at 70k.

The value of money is determined by the people.  ..Stay with me and help me. I'm open to crypto but the thing that no one ever answers for me is.....What happens when US and China roll out their digital currency?  ..And keep in mind, the government controls the internet...If government controls the internet...and they 100% do......What happens to any digital currency that is not that country's legal tender?..Anyone care to chime in?
1
Im no expert as you can tell, but I’m guessing same reason people bought at 50 or 60. We all expect it to go up and up 😅
1
Depends how you do it...If you're waiting until a specific time/price point, then that's timing the market...If you just buy when you have money, on a set schedule, then it's not timing the market.

I wish more people thought like you...Don't wait to he told what the economy is like, see for yourself...Think, in the great depression what did people see? Nobody bought shit but food and necessities.  And not like "omg I can't live without my netflix"..The second you see Netflix, Amazon and other companies people spend their money on just because they want it, say they are losing profit, or the moment you realize damn, nobody is buying shit but food, that's when you know the economy is collapsing.
8
Planned interest rate reductions were priced in. The drop in the stock market and coins is the reaction to the stable FED stance. Shouldn’t lead to a large collapse of the economy though.
1
Strong for who?
1
Sir, 3x and “I’m pretty certain” have no basis in the future. 3x is hardly a pattern. You are just anecdotally speculating based on extremely limited past results.  ..I am long so hope you’re right but not a fan of baseless promises based on literally nothing secure.

I dropped $10k at 61k  and I'm waiting to drop another $10k if it goes lower. We're basically in the same boat LOL trust me we'll be just fine in a couple weeks or so

My favorite one is invest answers, and I can't quit him! I'm a subscriber and Patreon user. He's very bullish but also has good data, seems very experienced, and is easy to watch on 2x speed. I am holding long term, so I don't think it matters too much but it still makes me mad. The other one is CTO Larssen, a little more level headed but more advanced and sells investment trading signals and classes that seem very expensive. I don't like cryptoverse, or Camel finance - seems too condescending and hedges what he says so he can go back and say "I told you so". They all do that to some extent.
2
How so? My average is at 25k this bull run and if we break 60k I’ll sell half my portfolio, didn’t even take 24 months lol

What kind of Internet traffic is blocked by the US Govt? Bitcoin is free speech and is protected by the 1st and 4th amendments, so I have no idea what you mean with regard to USA. (China is a different story and crypto has already been banned there, but is widely traded in the gray market - Google "Dylan Run, Shanghai")
1
Well it sure will, but it will sure go down as well 😂 and most often further down than expected. Just don’t panic sell, then you are good, but people still do it just like they invest when we hit ATHs
1
You can’t buy bitcoin if you don’t have money, let’s get that out of the way. ..If you’re waiting until a specific price-point, you’re not DCA’ing. If you’re waiting until a specific time of day/week/month/year, you’re DCA’ing. DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, *regardless of the asset's price*.

Ya til the defaults happen. Right before The Great Depression people were living it up too.

People are already there..

That's all the data we have though. I'm not making any promises these are just my estimates. Historically, 6 months after the halving is when a parabolic move starts which lasts almost a year. This is caused by the halving itself which is a deflationary protocol against FIAT. ..Last cycle was hindered by FTX and all of the scandals and corruption. Now that this is mainly over with I believe this cycle should be clean. ..My only worries are:..- Fed interest rates.- Escalation of war (for now it seems that just proxy wars.- BlackRock and other ETFs manipuating market .- Future recession on the horizon...These factors will decide how parrabolic the price movement will be. My best adivce is to exit sooner than later in 2025 and not to get greedy as the price will tank most likely end 2025. ..None of this is financial advice, lol

Yeah just remembered it’s called advanced, got it mixed up with Binance pro

Oh thanks, good suggestions!

I misspoke- fixed it

And even more with Bitcoin that is very volatile

Bingo, we have found the winner! 
1
I can only hope because that means next month it will cost less for a few percent.
1
im set on 55k buy, so close.
1
It’s been like this since the beginning. Nothing new here at all.
1
Yea basically
8
Yeah I’m no stranger to Lazy. I had seen DCA posted hundreds  of times. I also never bothered to find out what it meant. I think it’s a good simple technique to follow.
1
>DCA. the market ALWAYS drops after halving as miners and Whales take profit, then THEY RESTART the cycle again. These next two months WILL BE accumulation periods until ATH around April 2025..like I said, you speak with certainty yet have no actual certainty. Only speculation based on information...of 3 iterations. You are the type of bitcoiner that basically doesn't actually know what they are talking about; just hopes and uses info to rationalize their hopes.
1
What? We have only had 3 iterations though so there's no other data to go off. Btc has followed the same cycle each time, the only thing that differs is the length of the Bullrun based on external factors aka economy. ..I've already been through 2 cycles and this is playing out the same. Trading is about predicting the future based on data. Nothing is certain obviously you could die just leaving your house. But when all the arrows are pointing in one direction it's likely got some truth to it. I'm not just making this shit up from the top of my head there's a lot of historical data to back up what I'm saying.
1
Do you understand that “likely” does not mean certain?..Because you certainly don’t understand that 3 does not actually mean likely. ..Just because something has happened 3 times does not mean it will or is even likely to happen a fourth. It just means you may have a reason to believe one way or the other. ..Price speculation is not a science. 3 times in your experiment does not mean you have discovered a law. ..I hope you get this and stop circlejerking bitcoin. I get why you think it may spike but that doesn’t at all mean it will and you certainly have no basis speaking as such. Neither do I.
1
Lol, I'm guessing you're a troll. Have you heard of probability and what trading is? ..All I was saying were my estimates of the price. Don't feel but hurt just cause it's dropped 20%..Literally nothing is certain other than death.
1
Exactly, probability. But You literally said “will be” in your original post. Do you see the issue?..Stop moving the goalposts. ..Language matters. Not everyone who proves you incorrect is a troll.
1
You haven't proved me incorrect yet as it is the future. All I said in my original post was that BTC drops after the halving and that the Peak of the Bullrun will be around April which using probability is most likely. ..It's not like I'm giving financial advice I'm just giving my opinion of what I think is most probable. If WW3 breaks out this October then my estimate will change.
1
It does not though. ..That is no law. ..You’re just a hopeful circle jerker who can’t see past their own damn words. ..Either you have poor reading comprehension of your own words or you’re just trying to rewrite history. ..You spoke as if something will happen not based on evidence you think it might or is likely happen. ..It’s people like you that give rational folks a bad name, and then double down when they are called out. Clearly you don’t want to admit anything so we are done here. ..Should have moved on when you tried to deduce my BTC position from my argument. Some people, I’ll tell ya.

This is an EPIC TROLL, hats off to whomever spawned this idea.

The silly way to spread keyloggers...
58
I mean technically it would work as a hard wallet
36
Of course the world's leading expert on cryptography is going to put his seed on a floppy drive, label it "Bitcoin Seed", and of course not password protect it. So logical!

engagement farming

what people do for some useless karmapoints...
28
I can't see Satoshi going to a thrift store to buy a USB floppy drive in 2009.
45
If it was me, I certainly would boot up my windows 98 machine with a 3,5 inch floppy reader that is collecting dust in the attic, to check what is on there. Worst case scenario, nothing. Best case scenario, Nakamoto's keys.
17
Used a fridge magnet to store it on the fridge for safe keeping.... ???

Use a Throwaway Computer not connected to anything for it and try your luck \^\^ with reading it.

The Bitcoin is IN the floppy!

Imagine making a bunch of these with the rick roll video on them and dumping one at each good will

But do you still have the PC for it??
3
How long ago do you think 2008 was?
3
Just get a floppy reader and load it into a machine you hardly use and not connected to any Internet or accounts and see what's in it. Mostly nothing but work a check.

Yeah, a virus

I would be dancing my way to microcenter if I was you

Who even has a floppy disk drive these days, I have an old system which does but anything I bought in last 10yrs doesn't have one, hell I was pissed when I was looking round my laptop for the eject button only to find not even a bloody dvd rom 😂
2
Sods law dictates it to be genuine, but the last 3 1/2 inch floppy drive in existence just died.
2
100% chance there's a 99% this has a ton of Bitcoin on it
2
For anyone who cares, 3.5” disks have been around forever, entering the PC side of things with the PS/2 computers of ‘87. USB drives that read them are still readily available for less than $20US. Sony stopped making 3.5” disks in 2011.
2
Wow, look at that you found the crypto OnePiece :D
2
I’d take it to the Russian embassy .
2
Mold: allow us to introduce ourselves.
2
actually this is a great idea to earn money on flea markets, just write Seed backup bitcoin and 50€ for a floppy, when sold, replace with new one :)
2
Keep us updated thanks

Fake post… There’s so many of these type of posts today. Look 👀 https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/s/m9Jpjcniyr
2
Bought from a charity store I’d say your chance is 50/50. Bitcoin began January 2009. I could definitely see using a floppy disk to backup data back then. Really, on the tail end of its life by use from mass consumers but still usable even today. Believe it or not, N.A.S.A and a lot of airline companies still use this out dated technology. I would buy a cheap throwaway PC just to check it out. Worst case, you toss a PC and out a few bucks. Best case, you’re going to remember who suggested this and we both live happily ever after.
2
Ink looks fresh.
2
So this is what caused the drop today. Hmpf
2
Go find an old computer with a flappy disk  Drive at Goodwill and find out
2
It boggles my mind that the person who made this somehow thought that putting "S. Nakamoto" on the thing would make it *more* believable

It's a joke, these weren't in use in 2008

Oh, that's a floppy. It won't work. Physical drives are embarrassing to be seen with. You know, you're in with the streaming kids like Netflix, Disney, yeah. Not with the awkward old neckbeards that still have DVDs and God forbid floppies...Send it to me, save your embarrassment.

Well, either you got a old useless floppy disk or you are going to be a billionaire. Guess what is the most probable option 😆

Fyi, in case anyone thinks there is a chance (also fun fact)... seed words didn't exist until AFTER Satoshi left the project.

Just to spoil the joke:  .BIP39 was published end of 2013.

BIP39 seed came much later after this floppy

Keep us updated please ahah

Brilliant!

just imagine thats the way how Satoshis Bitcoins come back on the market. 1 Million Bitcoin on a fucking floppy Disk🤣🤯

It’s worth spending 15 bucks on a floppy drive reader. (I forget the proper terminology)
1
I do
1
Sandbox?
1
Update’s 😅
1
Damn. What a great way to get junk boxes sold....Satoshi was on the for front of computer technology......At the start of bitcoin floppy disks were already a decade obsolete. He didn't use floppy disks.
1
It has ’something’ in it alright
1
That tape used as a label is not old enough. If the tape was the same age as the disk it would be yellowed and lifting up.
1
A nice virus for sure
1
Sounds like when I empty out a gift card, I write "$345.85" on it and drop in a parking lot.
1
Seeds did not exist at that time.
1
Extremely doubtful. .Bitcoin came along long after 3.5s were obsolete.
1
Update us
1
Well in 2009 it wouldn’t have been labelled a “seed”, that all came later. ..It would be labelled private key, right?..I remember “brain wallet” became a thing in like 2012, then a couple of years later the standardised seed phrases became an option.
1
Someone put gunpowder in the floppy disk - say bye-bye to your drive.
1
How exciting, worth a shot
1
Send it to me, I will sort it out!
1
Lol
1
I 100% would bought it and then had to order a disk drive for it.
1
Pull the hard drive and network cable from your PC, load a live Linux distro, check the floppy.
1
Yes. No. Yes. No.
1
The charity shop probably wrote this so you buy their shit
1
In 2008 I had a dvd burner. It would be kind of sad if Satoshi was writing on floppy disks while a 12 year old was burning on dvd.

On a 3.5” floppy?  Timing doesn’t seem right.  I like the sense of humor of the seller! “Got a big ass box of these old disks.. how can I offload these fast at max value” ha!
1
Could open it on a library computer maybe
1
The name is suspect
1
woah
1
Probably a joke but I'd still check it, all you need is as floppy drive to look at it..Obviously do it on a protected throw away device
1
Anyone in their right mind would never save seed phrases in a floppy disk which were already obsolete when btc came out. But you never know.
1
Whas it called a seed back before word lists were invented for BTC?
1
Omg best prank ever, or u are the richest person on earth.

Looks brand new too, aren't you a lucky camper

Since everybody is saying it probably has a virus, get yourself a dummy computer and put it in. See what happens.

I have a 3.5" floppy reader I just took out of my 2011 PC that recently died due to a bad motherboard capacitor, send it to me I'll hook it up to my 1998 windows laptop system that I use to tune my 1987 Buick Grand National.😁
1
That was a perfectly good floppy, why did you write on it with a sharpie.
1
Send it to me and I will look at it
1
I can still hear and feel the ASMR of ejecting one of those and flicking the spring-loaded cover to the left. So satisfying.
1
Plug it into a library computer and check lol.
1
Love the redundancy measures on the backup. Like a solar powered torch. 🤣
1
90% is a virus..10% there is legit coin on it..I would put that in a test device and see what happens
1
Not too sure why anyone would put their name on something like this but add to the fact the name just happens to be Bitcoin’s inventor, this is definitely malicious. For shit’s and giggles open it up in a VM cause hey, crazy things happen.
1
So that's where I lost it!
1
Ha brilliant!.Although there’s surely a massive gap between these 2 technologies!
1
Simple.  Find an old disposable computer with a floppy drive.   None of your information is on it.   Don’t connect to the internet .   Insert disk and explore.  Worst case is you have an old bricked computer.
1
Send it to me. .I have 3 1/2 inch floppy drives.

Love the idea of people using floppy disks in 2008. It's like VGA or PS/2 ports in the age of HDMI and USB.

OP trying to kill time, well done for that..Old floppy disk with brand new, freshly stuck masking tape, and freshly written on. I work with this stuff daily.
1
I would load it on a pc that does not have an internet connection and could easily be wiped in infected.
1
If you have a floppy disk reader then have fun with a virus :)
1
HAHAHAHAHA
1
I think those discs only have space for 11 words, so you are good. False alarm.
1
idk why this one gives me a good laugh 😂

I would buy a cheap old PC with floppy disk reader and find out. Because it is a once in a lifetime thing.

1
You didn't even use a "seed" back in those days. Should have written "wallet.dat" on it... 😉
1
even it had a virus it's outdated and won't effect your PC.
1
Open it on a library computer if it even has a drive for it
1
The tape and marker on look pretty fresh to me. Its probably a frogger game. Haha!
1
Definitely only put it in an OLD computer connected to NOTHING,  preferably one that has a freshly installed operating system so it doesn't have access to any old banking information etc should it have some type of script or virus on it.   Just a thought.
1
10k $ or more if it has actual bit coin
1
Seeds didn't exist in the satoshi era.
1
I'd booted up in an old computer that I wasn't online or connected to anything. Something I didn't mind losing. Just to be sure. But you'd still have to have the compatible mining software and go with it. And who knows which software that was?! And bitcoins have been around a lot longer than people expect. I remember some old Nintendo video game tournaments from the late '90s we're giving away bitcoins as prizes for like third and fourth place.
1
Definitely use Linux to view the files.  A windows machine will likely run the virus on that floppy.  "It's a trap"
1
use vmware virtual box and mount the floppy disk reader to it somehow?
1
You either have a virus or a shitload of BTC.
1
Looks shady AF
1
Yes.  Severly degraded polycrystalline magnetic material composed of iron oxide.
1
Try it on your boss’s computer
1
This is a great marketing idea for a floppy players manufacturer. Donate these to all the goodwills and charities around and wait for the online orders
1
Find an old scrubbed computer with no internet connection that you can afford to trash and check it out 🤷🏽‍♂️
1
Oh look, a 3d printed save icon. So cool.
1
Send it to me, i would tell you!
1
Someone is having fun.
1
I'm prepared to have a look
1
Nope, there was no such thing as “seed” back then! Maybe it’s the key 🔑
1
Craig gonna sue you…and lose lol!
1
LOL nice try Satoshi.....
1
Put it in your grandparents pc to find out!
1
You wrote that!
1
send it to me and ill let you know
1
There were no seeds back then :)
1
It reminds of computer class in high school. My friend and I would write “SMUT” on all the floppy disks. We thought it was hilarious.
1
With 1.44mb I’m gonna say it’s a picture of a bitcoin seed 🤷🏼‍♂️
1
Just disable autorun and don't run exe files and you risk 0 virus. ..Wallet file should be a data file anyway, not exe. Even if encrypted. ..Or if really paranoid disable your main disks in BIOS and boot live OS from USB/CD.
1
Update please
1
As with all disks that you find, you should 100% put it into your computer to find out.
1
2009, I would definitely used a CD, but that’s me, last time I saw a floppy was probably 2005
1
oh there is definitely SOMETHING on it
1
2009, I would definitely used a CD, but that’s me, last time I saw a floppy was probably 2005

I call this post bullshit
1
yeah i would put it in the pc where i stored my bitcoin keys, what could go wrong?
1
Pop it into a sandbox unix machine and see wth is on it
1
90% chance it's a funny troll.10% chance its malicious (malware)..Less than 1% chance, I would say basically 0 chance honestly that you are now filthy rich...Things I notice:..1. The tape doesn't look wore down (and 10+ years old). .2. Floppy disks were already very uncommon in 2009. .3. I doubt he would label it like that.
1
For the price of Bitcoin I’d be taking that chance
1
Just load it on a VM of windows. Virus? delete the VM. I doubt it’ll be programmed to escape the hypervisor.
1
Boot up a Linux VM then load this bad boy in to see whats on it..

Get a super cheap old PC off eBay and try it 🤷‍♂️

It’s got a game demo for an Atari St. 100%
1
Doubt any one would  store a seed on a floppy. Are They are too prone to failure.
1
Lol. That inks too fresh
1
Don't you put that in your computer dummy
1
Too bad Satoshi is CIA or some other intelligence agency. Was never a real dude, sitting in his basement in Japan, nerding out for the good of mankind...Notice the date and events happening when those whitepapers came out.

Definitely porn or [WORM.COM](http://WORM.COM)
1
Use library computer lol
1
you could have the seed words but without the address it has no use, good hunting.

If the disc inside is kind of floppy I think it could be mine.

I swear the keys exist somewhere it’s crazy to think about
1
I would take the risk with an old computer/laptop and maybe a Linux distribution started from usb to connect a floppydrive and read it....
1
Oh shut up. That tape is new.
1
Run it in a vm to see
1
Put it in a PC you don't have sensitive info on ? Public library, old set up you don't use, buy something super cheap if the other two arent options etc etc like someone else said you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. If you can find a system that isn't connected to any of your crypto or personal info what really is the risk? Especially against the reward.

I’d say buy a cheap ass desktop and try it out
1
Realistically, Bitcoin wasn't even invented until 2009. Why would anyone put seed files on a floppy disk? Flash drives had existed long before then.
1
Go pop it in one of the library’s computers and see if it’s real or a virus😂
1
I’M SATOSHI.
1
dude… bitcoin is from 2010 not 2000… nobody used floppy disks in 2010… usb sticks and cd burners.
1
looks fake as shit. The marker and tape have been put on there in the last 20 days.
1
lol Who the hell was using floppy disks in 2009?
1
Check it out then
1
Not too surprised to see many people here can't tell a joke when they see one.
1
Run to your nearest old library that has a computer with a floppy drive and yest it out...If its a virus let the government fix it, lol...Win-win. The hell you pay tax for anyway?
1
Could you take it to a local library that has a floppy drive reader? Or an Internet cafe? ..Or buy a junk computer, do NOT connect it to your WiFi or any local network, and see what happens. Might be worth the $100 or so, just to see what’s on it. ..*not IT - but that’s probably what I would do
1
You didn’t buy it so it can just sit on a desk.
1
Dude… really? April fools
1
I have a video of Satoshi speaking and it's on BetaMax if anyone's interested...
1
Could definitely be a trojan.  Send it to me and I'll check it out for you. No charge.
1
Put it in a work computer and find out
1
If it does have the seed or .dat file on it there's a high chance it's been encrypted. If you don't have pen tester skills it might be a bitch and a half to break the encryption.
1
Yes, a fake label
1
Lol, you could get USB memory sticks in 2009
1
Sure, Link to Rick Roll.
1
Sure go ahead and download it
1
lol. Signed by the man himself. Must be genuine!
1
Just use a fully isolated never before used laptop, use a public WiFi (if the virus hacks into that too), see what’s there, and whatever that is just write it down on a piece of paper...If that’s a seed, likewise, install a new soft wallet, and see if the seed works. ..If it does, then i don’t know what next tbh…
1
Time for OP to buy a cheap budget computer that isn't connected to their internet to check and see if it's legit or not... If if's legit, you only gain, if it's just a virus, you're just down like 200-300 dollars, I guess... Idk how much a floppy disk compatible computer would run you
1
Probably useless. Mail it to me and I'll check for you.
1
No, send it to me so you’re safe.
1
Clever way for a co-worker to hide his kiddie porn. Don't fall for it.

1
Perfect situation to use an air gapped machine that you don't care about! Honestly, you can pickup an old machine for dirt cheap to be used for situations like this, those random USB drives, and so on. if you get a virus it's whatever. If it's one of those USB killer things (have yet to come across in the wild), it's also whatever since the machine was cheap and not your daily.
1
Maybe he just blew his load all over the floppy and it dried.
1
put it on ebay
1
I have a old computer - send it to me and I’ll suss it for you
1
You have to play to win!
1
Lol
1
don't like to read all comments but short answer in 2008 3,5 inch floppy wasn't common to store your seed!
1
That's an easy way to get you to give up all of your own info, but worth a shot. Who knows what it could be.
1
Bro just found the real pirate treasure
1
Let me tell you a quick story. Some time ago, Western governments wanted to sabotage Iranian nuclear production facilities. You can read the full story [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet). A malicious piece of code was loaded onto a USB drive and they drive was left conspicuously where someone working at the facility would find it. They took it into work and plugged it in and the worm did its job. ....Moral? Don't do this on a machine. At least use a virtual environment to open it.
1
Easy set up and old computer don't connect it to the internet and check it out.
1
Yeah, the I-Love-You-Virus! 😆
1
Try it
1
Lmao
1
Buy a cheap used computer, and if it doesn’t have the floppy disk drive, buy one. You’re probably in $150 to see what’s on it. Could pay off, could be out $150.
1
Looks like the ink is still wet on that label
1
lol
1
Definitely an old school AOL or Compuserve install disk.
1
That is some top tier OPSEC, to put your burner online id on your personal data. Also, Satoshi left Bitcoin before seeds where a thing, and that storage medium was long obsolete in 2009...
1
Try it on a VM or a Computer without any information or connection to the internet just to be safe, I'm 99% sure it's a virus man
1
Run it on a Linux os

Wooow big if real

Look like it is time to schedule a trip to the library!

Send it to me- I will try it on my old Compaq and split what I find with you.

Sit it on top of a speaker for a day to remove any virus.

If you’re not first, you’re last. Shake and bake baby.

Possibly legit...Here’s a story:.Around 2010/2011, Time Magazine ran an article about Bitcoin. It was about under 10 cents a bitcoin then. I read the article and, although I’m not a risky person at all, I told myself I would buy $100 of it. Back then, you had to call in or order it from some exchange or whatever. Can’t remember clearly but, again, I wasn’t a risky investor or an investor at all. ..Time passed and I never got around to getting my thousand bitcoins and that is the story of how I almost became a millionaire. ..Anyway, during that time I worked for a company that still used floppy disks 💾 as the main way of saving our work. ..So yes, that floppy disk you found can possibly be legit. However, the sticker that says “seed backup” seems like a newer, more recent term. ..So…it could be a savvy investor from the early days of Bitcoin, it could be an ingenious way that someone thought to save their passkey, or it could be a joke and filled with a virus...But if I were you, I’d probably find a way to check what’s on there cuz you don’t want to be filled with regret and have a story about how you almost became a millionaire too. 😔
1
Get a pawn shop computer and put it in...Or give it to me and I will put it in
1
Nice try dude. Trying to nonchalantly peak interest on the obviously fake disk to get some gullible idiot to buy it. I know your tricks, Dewey! 😆🤦🏻
1
We are collecting horcruxes now
1
funny maaaann
1
Its so old it probably doesn't have any data on it
1
Lol
1
HODL
1
If you’re scared of a virus, buy a cheap computer with a floppy drive. Shouldn’t be that hard buddy.
1
Probably 1 dickpic
1
That masking tape is days old. 30 years using that thing, I know
1
Buy a cheap air gap computer and floppy reader.
1
Yes
1
Please send it to me and I will check it for you. You are welcome to PM me.
1
Buy an old PC and try it.
1
Looks like one of those iykyk items storage garage auctions put just inview to hike up bidding.
1
Going to start leaving these everywhere and fill it with 90's futanari hentai
1
Definitely looks like it was written quite a while ago
1
Looks like it has fresh sharpie on it
1
Use a rasberry pi to scope it out and a floppy drive hooked up?
1
I would find an old ass computer and load that up
1
Download a USB installer for some flavor of Linux. Remove the HDD/SSD from your pc. Put in an empty one. Spin up a Linux machine using the install disk, grab a USB floppy drive, and take a look.
1
Ignore, everyone. So e Muppet is listing the same label on multiple items saying they found it here or there. Attention seeking. Seen some other posts, exact same writing in a label on different items
1
My two concerns are the fact that it says “bitcoin seed backup” which seems silly to me, because the person who wroteit on there is just making it a target + why would it say “S Nakamato”? That part just seems ridiculous and fake lol, even if he did own it, why would he put his alias there. Seems way too good to be true
1
I will run it on a  no network Linux VB just to check.
1
Why would it be on a floppy disk instead of a thumb drive?
1
Get an old disk reader and hook it up to a machine with a fresh windows install that doesn't have any of your information on it.
1
Go to your neighbor and ask if you could use one of his old PCs. 😏
1
Your back door was unlocked.
1
It'll be a YouTube link to Never Gonna Give You Up.
1
Just load it into an old laptop that's not connected to the internet & see what's on it. If it contains a virus all you've done is infect an old laptop that's not connected to anything.
1
And here I am wanting to open it just to see what kind of sketchy shit is actually on it. Id totally throw this in an old/unused machine not connected to any network just to see what surprises are on there.
1
Doesn’t everyone sign their floppies?
1
You should buy an external floppy disk reader and plug it into a computer at Best Buy.
1
Yessss, some bitcoins 🤑
1
Buy a $50 laptop with a floppy drive and try it.
1
I would check it out could be worth billions.
1
That’s not where I left It
1
You will have to find old computer which has this slot or a reader which can read this...
1
Mr Nakamoto would 100% write it in English lmao
1
If you have a PC with a floppy disk drive, it probably isn't worth much.  With that said, do it knowing your PC may be compromised and don't do it on your home network.
1
Scam. The tape is too fresh to be real.
1
Lol
1
Homework Folder ?
1
Load that shit up immediately

My Computer didn’t even know what to do with that nasty krusty floppy back then when it was on 80€ (2014).
1
Try it with a virtuel box
1
with 1.5 Mb’s? You couldn’t save the Bitcoin Logo on that drive.
1
some naked photos of Hunter Biden
1
Nobody was using that in 2009!
1
Yall are going about this wrong, you auction that as “authentic-lly found antique disc never opened”- then buy bitcoin.
1
Broooooo one way to find out!  Go get u a crap computer and upload that disk.
1
I doubt it. Send it to me and I’ll check it out
1
This post just gave me a great idea. I’m gonna start leaving these everywhere 😂
1
Send it to me. I’ll take a look for you 👀
1
When a gigantic dildo appears on your frozen screen you’ll be the first to know !
1
Yes a nice joke
1
No one was using floppys in 2009
1
If it hasn’t degraded. Take a look at the guy that is over in England that was digging through the dumpster or the landfill forever looking for his because he threw it out. I had a friend of mine that well he packed up a bunch of his stuff when we moved him and his disappeared wasn’t on a floppy that could possibly be,  good luck.
1
What if he did just write it down or store it somewhere like this and then died without telling anyone?..The Satoshi wallet is going to be the ultimate treasure hunt for future generations. The person who solves the mystery and figures out the key will get access to the greatest fortune in history. The allure of that alone is going to going to create a digital version of Oak Island times a billion.
1
You let me know.
1
Whooo!  A physical representation of a save button?
1
virus inverter 3 iodt s
1
These attention posts are crazy...
1
Good luck finding a computer with a floppy disk drive haha,  it might be a good idea to buy one specifically for this in case has a virus tho
1
Probably that Russell crowe virus from Virtuosity
1
Omg
1
I’m not falling for that one again.
1
A link to the Rick Astley video.
1
So does it have something on it?
1
This just gave me an idea for a wicked April Fool's prank.
1
Prob has something on it thats gonna make you not allowed near parks or schools
1
The Lord hates a coward- If you don't know how to view the files without putting your machine at risk, just befriend a nerd who knows something about computers.
1
Nope you should give it to me so I can dispose if it properly
1
I mean only old ass computers even have a slot for that it's worth infecting one just in case it's actually legit
1
Lol
1
Considering that Bitcoin was started by Antigovernment thinking individuals absolutely CDs can actually degrade  over time if stored properly floppy disks can store data for at least 50 years as evidence by the US strategic Missile Command
1
floppy disc predates bitcoin by 20 years who would put anything but Oregon trail on there?
1
It would be worth getting a 2011 pc w/ a floppy drive to see.
1
Fake
1
Floopy disks were already obsolete when the genesis block was mined
1
Lol
1
It's worth finding out
1
Send it to my house to be safe, I’ll check it for you for viruses.
1
No
1
Probably a virus
1
Send it to me. I’ll check it for you.
1
it contains the *.dat file from the old QT wallet… chaching-chaching…. ;-)
1
Could be a billion dollars in Bitcoin or a ransomware disc waiting for its next victim.
1
I was wondering where my bootlegged copy of Their Finest Hour; The Battle of Britain went.
1
Play it and get Rick rolled and trolled? Or hit and laid and paid You decide don’t hide you’ll never know until you’ve tried
1
Haaaaaaaa
1
Oh, there it is.  DM me.
1
Update to this story: he got rickroll
1
It could have a disc covered in sandpaper or crushed matchheads
1
Bundestrojaner copy
1
Buy a computer and see what’s in that disk
1
I would risk it
1
Billions, probably
1
Maybe they wrote it to give someone false hope... lol
1
Send it to me, I've got a Grey box that I can mount it on and evaluate the contents for you.   PM me and I'll send you my po box😉
1
For what it's worth S Nakamoto is missing his original seed disk from when he first developed bitcoin 🤔
1
This is super cool. ..Go buy a new computer, head to library with public wifi and have some fun
1
confuse... how to open it?
1
Check it on a friends computer first
1
Floppies were way out of use by the time bitcoin was created. Good joke.
1
Even in 2008 /2009 Floppy Disk wasn’t a thing anymore. Would have been more likely to have it on a CD than a Floppy.
1
Maybe....connect a 💾 drive to a Chromebook and check it out? Lol....cause who's gonna "virus" (attack) a Chromebook lol?
1
Open on a old computer or buy just go into Best Buy and put it in a display computer and see what happens??? Best advice I have
1
The good news is any computer you're using to see what's on it is probably not connected to the internet.
1
We did that as a joke in 2016
1
plug it on an old compooter with no access to the internet and a clean install of windows.  id be curious enough to go out of my way to do that.  Then again I probably have more computers and virtual machines than the average person
1
Get yourself a scrap computer from a pawn shop.  Open that up.  If it's a virus, then just return the computer and say it's acting up.
1
It could be a virus... but it could also be a trillion dollars in the future.
1
Bullshit. No one was using floppy disk in 2008.
1
“The disk in Drive A: is not formatted. Would you like to format it now?”
1
treat it like a random usb flash drive laying on the ground- step on it and grind into pavement.
1
Probably old viruses that our new computers easily detect. Worth a shot. Check it out at work.  Lol
1
I own a floppy drive. Send it to me, I can check for you.
1
Prepare to be rickrolled
1
Yes, 1 floppcoin
1
Plot twist: Charity shop makes these to sell.
1
Bill gates brainz
1
They didn’t use floppy disk when bitcoin was made …. Only us old folk would know … if it was a usb drive it would be more believable
1
Who the fuck was still using floppies in 2010. ..This is a joke played on whoever went through the box. You.
1
Send it to me and I'll check it out for you 😉
1
F for update
1
Thats the saving icon op
1
It is probably gone. It is floppy disk. And I don't think it will have any data by now.
1
bid and sell
1
..I'm sure it's not related but.....[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b75lr3/somewhere\_a\_floppy\_disk\_contains\_enough\_money\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b75lr3/somewhere_a_floppy_disk_contains_enough_money_in/)
1
Bitcoin invented in 2009 not 1999
1
Ha! Good one
1
I would just open it on a work computer
1
😂
1
Most defintely s. Nakomoto wallet, go ahead
1
Find a computer and test it bro , you have nothing to lose haha
1
something with 9 kb of capacity i might be being generous as i have no idea.
1
I might start churning these out. Just need a cute old man to be the front of the business.
1
Has anyone checked if any BTC has been moved from Satoshi's wallet?
1
Gl
1
Did 2008 edition of computers have a floppy disk?
1
This is a great security method.  I would have opted for laserdisc.
1
Has Windows Vista 😆😆😆😆
1
Once you insert that disc, it's all over because the next time you access your crypto, it will be gone
1
Lol 😛
1
any success so far?
1
First you need to find a disk reader, it will be hard
1
you're old if you know what this is
1
I.44 megs of pure early 90s porn for the win.
1
lol, it was 2009, not 1999.
1
Lol
1
Imagine you get in and all you find is a digital receipt from that one guy who bought a pizza for like 300 bitcoin.
1
It’s either a virus, or you just became filthy fucking rich.
1
I think you’ve got a vintage drink coaster there
1
Id still risk it on an old computer unit
1
I bet few even know what to do with that.
1
I’d bet a bitcoin that it’s a rickroll lol
1
Only one way to find out.
1
Send it to me and ill check for you
1
Give it a go for sure....no point leaving it on the blockchain
1
I grew up learning to call these stiffies. I called the 5.25 inch a floppy because they were actually bendy..That was my dad’s nomenclature anyway. Just me?
1
Mount an external floppy to a VM and have at it.
1
This is the modern day equivalent of tying a dollar to a fishing line. Everything about this throws red flags for me. That tape is BRAND NEW. Edges are perfectly straight like it was just cut the other day. No yellowing or anything. That tape to me is a dead giveaway that something is up.
1
Jackpot! With malware
1
it most likely the seed for a wallet  for crypto. not he coins
1
It amazes me how much misinformation there is out there
1
Use someone else's pc, you're welcome
1
PACMAN.EXE
1
Someone left USB C 4k recording sunglasses at a playground. My idiot friend begged me to plug it in and see if we can catch a predator. ..Luckily I was wise enough to plug it into a machine which had Kaspersky installed and updated, and machine disconnected from the internet. ..As soon as we connected, there were Autorun scripts and the virus started spreading even though it was detected. Seeing this reminded me of that.
1
Send it my way and I'll check for ya
1
You used Google to check how his name was spelt, without a doubt 🧐
1
I know, I must be fun at parties, but given Satoshi's last message was in 2011, while BIP32 (the concept of private keys to be encoded with seed phrases) was implemented in 2013, the chances that floppy contains satoshi's seed phrase are quite slim
1
you’re looking for thoughts, interesting
1
No lol
1
Curiosity would get the best of me. Hopefully on an old computer with NOTHING else on it, but it would, 100% make me check it
1
If someone had a bunch of old external disk.Drives they wanted to resell on FB marketplace or eBay, then sprinkling old floppies around with bitcoin stickers wouldn’t be a terrible way to accomplish that.
1
If you have a spare PC (with a floppy disk drive) you definitely should check it out...If it contains viruses (or something worse) - you won't lose anything important...If it contains what it says it does - you won.
1
60% of the time you could be 100% correct
1
In 2009/2010 💾??? Suspicius
1
Sand box that shit and find out
1
Yes you should try and return it to the owner
1
Test it in a sandbox. Tell us what hapoens.
1
Lol it's a trap 😂🪤
1
You have to follow up on this. You never know, it could have a lot of BTC on it. 😀
1
Buy a thrift store computer to test it…
1
No. But i'll give you 5 bucks for it
1
You can find some old desktop at Goodwill, try it on that
1
Run it a desktop Linux program or whatever. One of those programs that are connected directly to your computer.
1
lol
1
Seed phrases only came much later, inception in 2013 but wallets implemented it slowly, so more like 2014-15. Until then, it was still mostly private keys copy pasta. Who was using floppies in 2013+ lmao   .. Joke at best, fake post for clout, or scam/virus/executables on it
1
I would buy some cheap used laptop and plunk it in just to see the virus eat the laptop.
1
Lol, floppy disks were obsolete for 10 years before bitcoin was even thought about.
1
Just run it using sandboxie
1
id buy it then open it on a laptop idc about
1
Who has a 3.5 inch floppy drive in these times?
1
So what was it?
1
You can get a USB floppy drive for $15 from Jeff Bezos. Sure, could have a virus. Got a backup? Got a computer you don't care much about?..Read that disk. I would. Might have the hash for 1,000 bitcoin.
1
I mean it would seem to me you should buy a floppy drive and some random cheap pc off Facebook market and plug it in. ..Could be a virus, could be someone’s seed phrases. ..Floppy for the last 10 years has been pretty decent OPSEC. ..When’s the last time you saw a floppy drive or something with one it for on a store shelf?
1
eBay that shit to the highest bidder.
1
Seeds weren't a thing back when satoshi was around
1
Hilarious
1
get that shit. look at files on shit system
1
Go to a library computer and check it. Who knows maybe there is a seed phrase on it
1
We still used those disks in the 2000s?
1
Open it in an old computer. One that you have nothing to lose if it has a virus.
1
Imagine if that was real
1
Buy a retro pc. And a flopoy drive.
1
Gee I wonder if OP just wrote that on there...
1
You found Craig Wrights stash.
1
Possible Bitcoin started around 2009
1
💰 from 2011
1
I turned a bunch of old floppy disks into coasters and wrote funny or random things on all of them, including "Bitcoin savings" etc.
1
It's been 25 years since a floppy disc has been at all relevant lol.
1
Run in a truly disconnected sandbox through Linux to asses what is visible, flip the script and create a batch file to autorun and change the outbound IP to yours and then copy it to a few cheap thumdrives under a .doc and hide attributes under a hidden folder that is triggered by initializing the .doc and dump the "system" on used hardrives.....Also, never...everrun anything off of something not from a trusted source or that's not new on a system without sweeping it first on a test device with nothing on it. It's 2024 folks... If I can come up with a better version of this scam than people WAY smarter than me will as well. Be safe and protekt yo shit
1
Lol go to the local library an see
1
If over 1k bitcoin I call dibs on 1 of them js. Good find man best of luck
1
Lol
1
I think it will have allot of bad sectors.
1
I have a floppy disk drive, so I’ll split whatever’s on it 50/50 with you. I’ll
1
Yes. .Is there a date on it. .That’s old school. .Yer gonna need someone with old school tech. If you wanna find out. .There are billions of $ dollars in lost bit coin. You might have found a modern day treasure chest.
1
Obviously there’s a note on it saying „Bitcoin Seed Back-Up S. Nakamoto“
1
run it in an offline environment
1
Bro,..Either get a throwaway PC or create a virtual machine on your computer and run it in a sandbox to prevent it from interacting with any of your systems drives...There's plenty of ways to get those answers.  Also you could create a disk image of whatever is on the drive and access anything that may on the drive on another system. ..Bitcoin has been around for years. I remember a guy talking about it in the mid 00's and about how long it had been around then. That was when they FIRST started talking about 3D printed guns. You could be sitting on a jackpot homie.
1
Lol very funny
1
Oh nice a save icon.
1
Go to your local library and open it up on one of their computers, not yours. Most of them don't know how to lock drive access
1
Unsure why anyone beyond 2000 would have used a 3.5 inch floppy, let alone anyone beyond 2009 who was also into Bitcoin.
1
Do they also have an external floppy drive they’re selling?
1
Mad virus or rags to riches you pick😂
1
No somebody’s fucking with you
1
In which department?
1
Go to the public library and find out
1
If this is real back up of 1 100 000 Satoshi’s BitCoin ? :D
1
That's next level security. Your first wall is finding a floppy drive.
1
Nope. Send it to me and I’ll check.
1
Floppies had been out of service for 10+ years when bitcoin was released.
1
If you can read it, I just tossed my floppy disk drive
1
Disk bomb! Match heads and varnish :)
1
😂😂😂😂😂
1
Run it in a sandbox 🤷🏻‍♂️
1
Weird. Someone 3D printed a save icon.
1
😂 😂 😂
1
😂😂😂
1
no one uses floppy since the 1990s. USB media was already mainstream by 2008. If anything it be in CDR like those AOL cds.
1
Only one way to find out
1
Bro this is brilliant. Nearly wet myself laughing
1
Yep Skynet lol
1
Who in the world still runs floppy??
1
Hey, so that's mine
1
Been reading some of these comments, like "Bitcoin isn't that old, and there's no way it could have anything on it." One thousand percent. The first PC I mined on (and the only PC I mined on) had a floppy drive. That was back in 2010-2012 when I worked in a tech-related field. I wish I still had that drive.
1
Run it through a virtual machine to see if it’s a virus or not
1
Go to a library and find kut
1
Or, ORRRR.....why not just use an old laptop/desktop you don't use or a public pc? That way your personal computer doesn't get viruses if you're paranoid.
1
You owe everyone 0.1 btc if there are bitcoins on it
1
At least if you want to see what's on it, it won't cost much for an old rig.
1
Will this fit in my usb-c port?
1
Probably  George Bush senior nudes
1
Lol such a great idea I'm going to head to Amazon now buy floppy and drop one in every place I go this weekend
1
I don’t know how I stumbled upon this group and I’m no computer guru but op, go to fb marketplace and buy a pos laptop for $50 bucks. Go to amazon and buy a floppy disk usb for $15. You may make the the best $65 investment in your life or you purchased 2 overpriced frisbees. Take the risk!
1
What a weird looking Usb memory stick
1
I’ll give you 30$ for it
1
That's a trap lol virus galore
1
I work at Imation, now it's employee owned and called ComDel Innovation.
1
It prob has midget porn on it
1
Get a throw away used machine and find out.
1
Go on, try it out, I dare you.
1
Get an older machine, install a new Linux version, connect to it internet and do all updates. Then disconnect and load the drive. If it infects who cares, format drive recycle, if it has bit coin maybe your rich.
1
1.44 mb of it doesn't matter you don't have a disk drive to read it
1
Prob a virus lol
1
Put it into your computer and find out.  Make sure it’s an old computer with all of your data on it.  Maybe ensure your connected to home or business WiFi and attach all your personal devices as well.
1
Yup
1
😂
1
Pretty sure this is a joke but for a fun hypothetical, I'm pretty sure the government would not let someone cash in on 60 billion of found money
1
Man... I'll check it out for you!
1
A big black d!ck will   pop up  on your screen   & then  take all your savings  ngl
1
Plug it in at the library yo
1
Careful. I found one of these and it had pictures of my dad putting a baseball bat in his asshole
1
Get a Linux machine and mount it, and see what’s on it
1
I'll give you 10$ for it
1
The liklihood that someone found this in an old junkbox when they were moving, and wrote "bitcoin seed" as a joke seems way more plausible. Sounds like the sort of thing I'd do if I was dropping a box of outdated tech stuff at a second hand store.  Now, extra points on slapping an auto-run with an old-school 1.44mb rickroll...
1
1 million BTC right there!! Gobble gobble hold!!
1
Who trusts anything to 3.5” floppy?  Clearly a scam.  nakamoto would’ve used a Zip disk.
1
Just go to a library or something
1
Pretty sure by 2009 we were rocking 64GB Flash drives.
1
Pick up an old tower from your local thrift shop with a floppy drive ( or pick up a USB one ), don't hook it up to ethernet, and run that bitch. ..Best case scenario, you fall into some money. Worst case scenario, you get a chuckle out of whatever autorun scripts pop up.
1
Yeah they used floppy Disk back in 2009
1
Who has a disk drive ?
1
A bigger danger is "found" USB drives with malware.
1
Yes. It has a sticker on it.
1
This is why I can't throw away any of my old computer parts.
1
Sounds like a Shady way for thrift stores to sell floppies instead of trashing them.
1
If it's a virus you can quarantine it in a VM
1
That sharpie ink is far too new
1
Floppy killer
1
It's going to be a rick roll virus
1
the owner of the disk: Albert Einstein
1
Open it in VMware
1
Could have malware I'd say lol an ol RAT with that honeypot.. don't use it
1
they make floppy disk readers with usb cable so not hard to access the data....  you probably have a bitcoin key to unlock tons of bitcoin....
1
I’d buy something on Amazon to try it out and then return it if it is in fact what we all know it is..
1
It's a trap!
1
Updates?
1
Some are saying windmills are an even bigger problem
1
I’d get or fire up an old pc and see. Nothing to lose maybe 1-2 bitcoins is huge.
1
Probably a troll
1
You found Satoshi Nakoto house?!  Nice.
1
It's a used floppy disk, so yes.
1
😂😂😂
1
I don't think the concept of "Seed" existed in satoshi's time. :p
1
I’d be impressed if it a copy of the Oregon trail or math blaster
1
I doubt he would have labeled something that important, on a floppy no less, and then ‘lost’ it lol
1
lmao good one
1
For the sake of the cost of an external floppy drive, I’d definitely check it out. I mean, zero chances it’s actually Nakamoto, but maybe it has some on there. Just imagine someone left 3/4 BTC on there when it was worth a few $.
1
Great marketing!

Everyone acting like you can’t put an executable in a flash drive. Wtf you all talking about, it’s just a storage medium. Maybe there are file size limits because of the FAT file system, but could be a virus for any modern system.

Worth the risk of you ask me. Haha

So just get a computer from said shop just incase 😂

Don’t listen these guys, they’re jealous of all that money you’re about to be swimming in.

But it’s 16 bits virus .. lol
6
Use linux, then.  The virus won’t work on it, besides it still has device driver flexibility floppy disk (not sure if win11 still supports floppy disks)

Whew does any machine still have a floppy disk drive
1
Oh yeah. That's a standard std.
1
Yes true but if he wants to try does he really care about the machine he'll have to dig up and use to look?
1
Don't temp me with a good time! Open that bad boy up!  (In a secured environment)
1
Good luck trying to find a computer that can take a floppydisk before worrying about the virus lol.
1
Imagine a 10KB virus tanking your PC
1
Use a cheap old windows machine. Disconnect from internet. Plug it with a usb to floppy adapter and see what happens!
1
Meh. Get an external floppy drive, load up a VM ware of XP, run it and see what's on it.
1
exactly, better not touch it,  I'd be happy to take it and safely dispose of it.  I'll even pay shipping.  :)

I am sure can get an old computer with a floppy drive (don't cost much and won't risk your own personal PC/Laptop) and see what it is. Virus or no virus, if it is the real deal, you be famous and rich!!!!

Yeah theres nothing on it. Better destroy it to be safe

I imagine some guy named Dave owns Dave's Floppy Disk Drive Emporium, and he plants these all over town. People find them, rush to Dave's, buy a $100 floppy disk drive, put the floppy in, open it up, find a .jpg that says "Thanks for shopping at Dave's!"
1
OMG imagine that

That’s a floppy wallet

So would a stone

Also, seeds weren't used in the beginning.  Wallets contained private keys.

These absolutely were in use in 2008, and still are.

Didn’t stop me from using a floppy disk as a wallet backup when I didn’t have any free usb sticks laying around...Aaaaand then I lost it :p

Just get USB floppy reader, it's cheap.

wallet.dat.exe
12
1.44 MB. I’m sure a text file with the seed phrase would fit. Not sure if the wallet.dat would fit. I never payed attention to the size of them.

No, there is enough space specially in the beginning of BTC.., I have a 3.5" floppy reader I just took iut of my 2011 computer that recently died due to a bad motherboard capacitor..😁

Lmao it’s 100% a joke. I doubt he would have used a floppy in 2009
1
Should have said nudes
1
Pretty sure I can still use a floppy disk in 2024.
5
how could a seed phrase be on a floppy disc if floppy discs aren't invented yet? of course floppy discs needed to be there first..just because it's unlikely, doesn't mean it's technically possible..someone commented that Satoshi was a retro fan..if you consider that old tech is increasingly irrelevant for hackers and that new systems are constantly spying on you or update automatically etc. etc. there is a chance he could've preferred older systems for more anonymity and safety

depends on the virus. It’s definitely likely to have multiple auto-run scripts targeting different platforms and versions for maximum compatibility. ..the tape looks new, it should be yellow and faded. definitely suspect

Dude, if "Independence Day" tought me anything is that you can put a virus even on an alien computer, no problem

Stick it in a fresh Linux machine.  Remove your HD and do an installation onto a USB drive.  Yes there are still vulnerabilities but this is by far the least risky.

Yes, windows 95 is the ultimate OS

You can put 32 or 64 bit software on a floppy disk.
1
I mean just don't dial up aol lirst lol
1
Just check it at a public library.

Unless read it with your main pc, bypass UAC precautions and give it admin access. Possibly not even that far...But then again, it may be because you have nothing that you would chase this pipe-dream.

The virus probably wouldn't even work on win 98. And if it did, what damage could it possibly do to a long forgotten machine with no important data from over 20 years ago...

I’d rather try and have a virus than not try and lose who knows how much $$

If the donor PC doesn't have any valuable info, just air gap it and send it. If there's a virus, oh well? Not really going to be able to do anything.

shots fired... /r/Bitcoin, you gonna take that?! XD
1
I was wondering if someone would say that!.I actually don’t know which it was but I definitely didn’t see too sizes of floppy floppy. So I assume it must be the 5.25. By the time I had my own computer it was all stiffy. Just remember the floppies from playing on my dads PC. Snake and qubert and other oldies..Good times :)
1
That would be too obvious... DUH
1
Well yes if you have a floppy drive
1
Well that's true, could be a "new" script on it.
79
Yellow and faded? Bitcoin isn’t that old.
83
In fairness, If it was in a box the label wouldn’t be yellow as there is no sun damage?
2
Indeed .
1
Yeah like #sudo rm -rf /

So then virtual machine.
1
Tape? That's a floopy or something.
1
Who cares throw it on a junk box and see what happens.
1
This one knows his floppies
1
I don't think I'd worry about auto-run scripts on a floppy. Anyway, if you're not running as admin, what's it gonna do?
1
It's a floppy disk technically...
1
Inks not faded either.
1
Just press shift when putting the disk in,..You're welcome.
1
Hopefully
1
Good call out on tape fading, that’s a good catch

why do people say suspect now. its suspicious, suspect isnt used to describe something as suspicious lol

Yeah, I meant a USB-connected "external" 3.5-in floppy drive, which I assume exists/existed but didn't bother to check. It was the most comical way I could imagine to use a 3.5 floppy in `09 (and probably the easiest in actuality)

*sees virus file* “hah jokes on you because my computer is a pile of junk, your virus is too good for it”

the damage would be...uhm...to not have a machine ready when you find a real disc with a seed phrase 😅..I don't know..you never feel like using 98? maybe for an old game or something? ...for some reason I think that would be a great new years tradition to have
-1
probably true, you can probably also scan it for malware if you look into it on a new system

DON'T YOU LOVE YOUR OLD MACHINE??? 😭

Good thing you've held onto it, then!

Iirc, they're like 1.44mb. .That's not enough for a single low quality picture these days. .It's amazing that we used floppy disks for so long.

Gotcha.

Lol, bitcoin is new enough that no one was using floppies back then either...

Wouldn’t fade much in the dark either
25
2 more years and bitcoin is a legally consenting adult
3
Bitcoin is 15 years old, tape can fade in less than a year highly plausible.
2
Maybe the tape was old when they used it. That tape turns yellow in heat or exposed to a Smokey environment
2
I think they referring to how new the floppy disk looks for how old those things are, sure you csn buy them new still but why.... 😆
1
My sweet summer child...
1
It’s like 20 years old 🤣 I’m not backing up this post tho, it could be a Reddit hoax
1
It's masking tape. Even if it was a year old it should be more aged than that
1
this disk is either a harmless prank, or a trap. If you want to take the “meh, how sophisticated of a trap could it be?” approach, then you probably haven’t seen enough traps yet.
1
It’s an idiom. Suspicious is still the correct technical term and is used interchangeably, but some differentiate them by having “suspect” be for something specific and “suspicious” for a general feeling.
1
Gross. Use a VM.
2
Not at all. Just illustrating the kind of risk that /u/OwlsAndSparrow is suggesting to be "really low"...The "Possibly not even that far." means that it may not even be necessary to give permissions in order to expose one to the risk that is typically associated with such reckless behavior...In your response, are you suggesting some kind of nihilism; that because there are already holes in security, that there is no point? Try considering the context of what you are responding to.

I like the possible idea of using antiquated technology to hold the coin though. Then again, my biggest fear would be magnets.

Big assumption there - depending on _where_ this floppy originated, it could explain the usage of it...Example - Japanese government only stopped using floppy 2 months ago!..https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx82407j1v3o..Not saying this floppy is legit at all! but there are places that are still actively using them.

Japan just stopped requiring floppies for certain government physical media submissions at the beginning of the year [https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/floppy-disk-requirements-finally-axed-from-japan-government-regulations/](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/floppy-disk-requirements-finally-axed-from-japan-government-regulations/)..That said, I remember how  big of a PITA floppies were.  No way in hell I'd trust it with preserving something important.
6
I lived in the boonies and was still loading up floppies for different things, Bitcoin aware people back then were likely to have old school niches like that
1
That was my very first thought. Bitcoin and floppy eras didn't overlap as far as I know. And the tape label hasn't aged enough or at all, pretty pristine condition... and who labels a disk with their own name? Unless you use a computer lab or other shared computer it's unnecessary. Seems like BS. Or an ARG -- But please do report back if you open it!
1
Japan still use floppy disks for their tax department etc.
1
Wouldn't that make it a good place for Satoshi to hide his seed phrase then??..It's actually not a bad idea if he kept an old computer with a floppy drive just to read the disk with his seed on it. If the tech is obsolete then the chances of someone else reading that disk is low.
1
A friend of mine got into bitcoin within six months.  Had spent $1000 dollars on it. He had everything stored on a floppy disk. Then lost the disk. So, it’s absolutely possible.
1
3.5 and 5.25 were around when bitcoin got started . . .
1
You'd use a floppy disc precisely to gatekeep your assets. Ordinary people aren't using ancient desktops or have a floppy console on-hand. Meaning if some rando got ahold of it, it's worthless to them anyway...Moreso what's suspect is the fact whoever this belonged too lost it at all. Like if you're willing to go through the trouble of using outdated tech to secure, you'd keep the disc closeby.
1
That’s exactly what I was thinking. Floppy Disks?  They are like the VHS of video.
1
Bitcoin Jan 2009..Floppy disk sales ended 2011
1
Nah man, I had a laptop when you could get a bitcoin for next to nothing. I had a floppy disc drive. I had to splurge to get an external CD drive.
1
Depends on what you do I guess.
1
This a thousand times! This is a trap for gen z’ers. In 2012 we already stopped putting floppy drives in machines for nearly a decade
1
I was in high school when it was invented. They did indeed use floppy discs back then; Flash drives had just become affordable within around 5 or so years and my school's library had a bunch of old floppy disks they sold for like 25-50 cents at first and eventually they just gave them away for free by the time I graduated. They were on their way out but they were definitely around.
1
Spend em while you got em
1
Good point. I can’t wait to hear how many coins were on it. Right now, it’s still Schrödinger’s floppy. So, it holds a superposition of both millions of coin and a virus that will crash the chain nodes until it is inserted into an old sweet, sweet 3.5” drive. *hands rubbing together*
4
There is no mechanism in Windows whereby a script from a floppy will start executing when the floppy is inserted or accessed.

A 24 year old kids grandma passed away and he inherited like 800k or something. He said the whole fam is well off so he didn’t need that kind of money right now. So he put 700k into Intel and 100k into some other shit. And wrote up this big huge post why he thought it was good and smart. And the next fucking day Intel dropped 25% 😂😂

My comment is a reference to a podcast that dives into this topic (Red Web), but yeah Ien and Hal 100% knew. Satoshi was the major driving force behind it though. Iirc there was a relatively recent transaction on Satoshi’s wallet too, after he was presumed dead/gone from that world.

That’s just not true. There are companies making brand new floppy disks right now. What do you mean “production ended”? Like the whole world just decided to uniformly all stop making them at the same time despite many systems still utilizing them? That makes no sense.
2
This dude floppies ^^^

Still? Omg that’s amazing 🤣

You would think they would at least use a ZIP drive by now…

That explains a LOT

I remember installing windows with about 20-30 disks.

That actually could explain a lot about what’s going on at boeing

I wonder how many 400s are still in service….29 sooo not many.

Well, I hope OP takes it to Boeing to try it out, I mean a it couldn’t get worse right?

lol wow

Yes Boeing also uses dawn
1
Until recently everything handed to the Japanese government was done on a floppy.
1
You have floppy adapters for that.
1
Talking of dates, Seed phrases only came much later, inception in 2013 but wallets implemented it slowly, so more like 2014-15. Until then, it was still mostly private keys copy pasta. Who was using floppies in 2013-14+ lmao
1
Can confirm, not necessarily boeing but I work as an engineer at a 500 company. We do use floppy disks to update modern machinery, we talking 5 year old modern.

Pls don't Update any Boing with this Floppy Disc !!!11

Some ICBM launch sites used huge floppy disks well into the 2000s.

Yeah, it is a cute idea but anyone who routinely used floppies would know better.

US intelligence still use them. They're the only things that have built in physical write-protection and can be erased quickly in emergencies. Secret squirrel guys on ships still routinely hand them off to the Admirals.

I wouldn't touch Windows Sandbox with a barge pole, much less use it in place of traditional VM's which are far more robust and configurable. Yes, technically it is a VM, but it's a very very poor one.

Actually, offline stuff is MUCH safer than anything new just sent in from wherever, over wifi network to the airplane or your car. (Just think about it, anyone can send something to your car or the plane to crash) your "in danger" 24/7 now...Never had ANY auto pilot problems or crashes due to computer programmer error... when only floppy disks were used.

Not so fast…. They could be excelling in all categories… lemme run some numbers and I’ll confirm shortly.

Sony, the last manufacturer of floppy disks, stopped producing them in 2011. However, some say that sales and use of existing floppy disks may continue until at least 2026. Since no one is making new floppy disks, the number of them in the world is finite and will eventually dwindle.
4
That fact that 3 1/2” are floppies is funny to me. Now the 5 1/4” those were floppy.

The best comment imo

747 is a make while 400 is a model, the 400 model launched in 1985 and mostly retired now with the latest model being 8 launched in 2010

lol! I remember reading an article about that a little while ago. I find it interesting when you still find legacy technology running in the wild like this. Makes me wonder how much they struggle to keep things operational? disc drive dies - how do they replace it?? old stock pile in a warehouse somewhere?

I believe some of our defense systems do as well.

I live in Denmark and go back home to the US once every three months. ..I do everything I can to avoid flying on a Boeing. ..At this point I just assume I'm going to die in a plane crash.
1
There's a video that haunts me somewhere online where a worker at Boeing walks around on the factory floor with their phone and simply asks  coworkers if they would fly on the plane they were building -- and not one person said yes. I was more like a whole lot of "hell no".

"bricks the plane" that made me lol.

I think the nuclear bunkers in US run on 8”.

What kind of nuclear? Power or kaboom?

As it should be..100% offline is 10,000 times more secure and safe for so much stuff.  Especially plane, car and nuclear plant updates...You want anyone, anywhere to tell your car, plane you're in or nuclear plant what to do? ..I hope not..Need in person updates..Much more secure.
1
Was going to say that nobody who’s ever had to rely on floppy disk for transferring their homework would call them stable,..but then I saw that it was a Boeing comment. of course Boeing would consider floppies to be stable
-2
There are a sizable number of lighting consoles in the wild that still only save to floppy.
1
Even if this is true, we're talking about companies that have to pay astronomical costs to make these changes. It's just about saving money. 2 different realities. No cypherpunk or crypto enthusiast put a seed on a floppy in 13-14+ lol    just no..

Magic for sure, but make them wet and they don’t work anymore. /s

To be fair, it's not like Windows 2 needed too much help from a floppy disk to go all blue-screen. It could do that all the time just fine with or without your homework!

What do you mean? Floppy's were stable, just really low disc space, but highly reliable.

Probably not in the bottom of a teenagers backpack for a semester stable... I give you that...
2
It's not that the floppy disk itself is stable. If it fails you just get another one....The drive that interfaces with the plane is stable.

Someone needs a good lay. And a bag of chips don’t count.

Winword is the executable name for Microsoft Word, a word processor that only ran on Windows, and included some desktop publisher features copied from the likes of Ventura Publisher. ..Little known fact: with Word, Microsoft pioneered the "infinite defects development methodology" where they would put buttons in the software for everything marketing had come up with and the "fix it" (actually program it) in later patches, so as to be able to "beat the competition" on the "release date". This obviously resulted in such spectacular bugs as erasing your disk if you put more than 255 files in one directory, which was a real problem in Word 1.0...While Word 2.0 was actually contemporary with Windows 3.1, my point still stands.

Hey you’d look like that to if you sold your house and took out a loan to buy bitcoin at 72k.

I had to send this to a newbie I helped get set up a couple of months back. He is still in the green but felt his first slight dip and looked real pale today

I sold at 16k and bought at 72k and sold at 63k. Parkour.

We haven't seen prices this low for at least 2 weeks
14
MAN do people need to zoom out.....
12
This "crash" is slowly painting a chart that shows these prices as support for an insane break out to 150K+ later this year
45
I know.. its funny.. I remember literally 2 weeks ago waking up one morning and checking BTC price, and it was 61k and I was so pumped! Like omg dannng it keeps going up.. then 2 weeks later it feels like a big drop. BTC is a wild ride baby!   Zoom out for perspective!
6
There was a lot of leverage thrown in on this recent move and euphoria set in. The market needs to punish that for a bit. But it will be back on its way up to new all time highs soon enough. Probably sideways action the next 3-4 months then we’re away
6
A real bitcoin holder doesn’t flinch. I’m mentally prepared to see it hit 30k in the next 2 months. IDGAF.
18
10k down from 73k is a crash?..We are still ~4x up from the 2022 bottom lol
11
I didn’t think we would be at 70k till summer, so I’m not worried at all.

😅🤣 so true

Each day above 60k is still a win in my opinion

I bought at $72

“WHAT IS THIS?? A dip for ANTS??”

I just started buying small increments regularly again the second it went back down to 63k

Easy cum, easy go.

The key is keeping your cost basis to the low single digits and hodling the fuck out of everything. Diversify, bend over, bite down hard

Bitcoin has not reach out ATH if you are comparing with fiat, 63K now does not have same worth of money than it had some years ago. If you consider inflation 63K now has lost real value

Honestly in glad it has retreated. Gives a bigger buy incentive as i'm definetely looking on buying more but wasn't sure about buying around 70k. If it drops to the 50s I'll buy
1
Did you all not check indicators before yall buy.  It’s sad many crypto investors do this and blame the asset.  What if it doesn’t go up for the next 3 years. I’m hoping you want to keep it that long

Both of these pictures are exhibitive of the wrong sentiments for investors and traders. ..Bitcoin is a commodity that has volitility and is always under manipulative attacks to scare people away and keep the price down. ..You need to ZOOM OUT, on those charts, and look at the weekly candles or monthly candles. ..And your investment should have a goal of several years unless you are a day trader. And most day traders that use high leverage are going to be exposing themselves to un-necessary risk. If you are good, use low leverage perpetual bets and have patience. ..For most people whom 99% do not have the skillset or discipline to daytrade crypto, just Buy and HODL (Hang On for Dear Life) for a few years. You will be glad you did. ..You won't lose money unless you sell too early...Databyter

Not if you just bought at the peak.

Seriously. I remember having a conversation with a friend who didn't want to buy at $1,000 because "it's got no where to go but down."
19
Right, when we dipped down to the $16k-$18k area, that was an exciting one!
29
I think lots of them are super leveraged people. I'm leveraged at only 2x and even at 2x I have to admit that these drops feel hard.
32
I bought LITERALLY at the all time high. I still haven't sold, because I bought to own bitcoin not speculate on the price of monopoly money. I'm about to buy some more when I get more monopoly money in my piggy bank.

I that’s what they said 2 1/2 years ago and it went to 16k lol...Call me crazy? But I’m out and gonna buy back in low when it crashes...The level of excitement and happiness is on par for it to happen.  I feel it.

Maybe not 16k but at least 35k to be on pair.

That has to be exhausting.  Why not keep your job *and* your Bitcoin?  Don't overestimate your ability to time the market.  DCA and work on those diamond hands.  If you do decide to sell: never go *full* fiat.  Stash a few sats and forget about it.

And he’s still planning on cutting production in April? This is horrible leadership, it’s almost like no one can change his mind.
162
Yeah that sushi whack a moto guy
93
Read somewhere he’s planning on raising prices soon saying his hands are tied.  I’d say his days are numbered
35
the board should oust him and replace with someone new...I hear the CEO of racism recently resigned
13
Satashi is selling all his shares. Is ded.
8
Does he think it’s Black Friday or what ? He should raise the price to offset inflation. Board of Management is not amused.
4
I love this analogy as we are all board members with a share of ownership.
3
He should be. Nvidia CEO did +250% this year for example.
6
I find it funny that there are people out there heavily underwater on btc holdings. Been like 2 weeks in all of history to make that happen but they're managing it lol.
20
If any of us, including you, wants the number to go up instead of down then we need to be applauding and supporting people to buy at those levels and much higher, not making fun of them.
19
It's me. I'm "any" 😓 haha
2
Anyone who just bought an peak and isn’t holding it must be very slow
1
What does he says now? Maybe I'll do the opposite
3
Think we ever see those prices again? I think if tether is fully exposed as a fraud, we will see these prices.
6
2x leverage is still gonna wreck you in a bear market, so not a good option.
13
Smart smart person you
1
The ETFs ARE retail paper hands. An ETF is just an investment an individual usually buys into with their retirement account.  Sure, some institutes buy into those same ETFs too, but they are mostly funded by mom, dad, jr and grandma.
6
ETFs will sell so fast when it goes up though
1
Hey a broken clock is right once out of the day lol great that worked out for you.
2
I fucking should have with my ppp damnit 🤣🤣 why I have to obey god darn laws ugh
1
it’s pretty scary when you’re new to investing, it takes time to develop a disconnect between yourself and your coins
12
All my homies hate 35k
11
Yes , i tip my hat to you sir 🎩.                                              😎
3
2022-23 wants a word with you.
21
For bitcoin to plunge to 30k you need enough liquidation on the 30k mark. It's impossible to say it cant happen, the market will do whatever the fuck he likes and get the money where its at.
2
I wouldn't rule it out completely. In December I would have told you to stop drinking, if you told me we would hit ath before halving... Strange days we are living...Personally I'm betting in the 50k range though
1
You mean like Binance owing 4 billion dollars to the US government that they can't afford to pay, the deadline for it being in less than a month? You mean something really bad like that?
1
It went to 16k after the cycle top was in (69k).   That was over 12 months AFTER the  previous halving.  The next halving is next month.    You guys had a whole year to buy under 30k and now your paranoid getting shaked out not even realizing the bull market starts  AFTER the halving.   Kek.
24
Totally fair. But important to remember how previous cycles were fucked by scams and frauds. Hopefully, nothing like ftx happens again cough cough.
3
what the fuck?..why weren’t you downvoted into oblivion
2
you do realize the latest money came from etfs? they aren’t short term holders. there aren’t as many paper hands anymore. the foundation is more solid.
1
You will keep waiting to buy thinking it’s will keep going later and then one day it won’t and you will miss the train
1
K dude.
1
Good question. Investing into BTC/crypto-ecosystem assets has provided \~50-60%+ return since end of November (quasi-uncorrelated w BTC volatility)
1
This satashi Motorola guy shouldn't be Bitcoin ceo after the downfall of Motorola
13
lol
6
As share holders can we vote him out?
11
Was it the nfl end zones? We did it!
5
Nvidia was a perfect storm scenario, though. They preconceived the surge in robotics so they we're immensely set up for success. Not really even comparable.
4
I didn't intend to be making fun of them. It's BTC, happens. I had a purchase at 67k range, I think, just a small one .05 BTC. But not worried, I'm sure it will be past that price this cycle. Currently just enjoying the fall, and waiting to buy cheap
4
Sorry man, don't worry it will return. I had a purchase in the 67k range I think, would have to look but still holding it
2
I don't talk to him anymore.
8
Binance owes a lot of money, deadlines are coming up, and they currently don't have the proper means to pay it, so it wouldn't surprise me.
1
Larry Fink is not paper hands
1
Yes but it takes several days for someone to sell or buy through ETF’s so it’s harder to “day trade”.
1
Twice ya moron
1
Something really bad happened
15
Binance owes a lot of money. They're going to liquidate their bitcoin assets eventually, it's only a matter of time. Who knows how much they plan on dropping. We could see something really crazy happen.
1
You’re all restarted as fuck. I didn’t say it can’t happen. I just said you don’t wish to happen
2
Nah, the miners know it’s coming, they pumped and are pulling out profits before they get halved this time.  The ETFs got the injection from normies, and now it’s gonna craaaaaaaash..They got you money already.  They want it.  You want it to keep going up, but they can’t get more out of you so it’s time to take it.
-7
Because this sub is getting overwhelmed with normies
2
I realize that.  I also understand they just sold a bunch of this stuff to the people, took all the money from interested parties already, and now we are stalled and it might drop again.  The money that’s coming in, is in already.  Now they need it to crash again to rinse and repeat the sucking of money from people.
1
We didn’t buy the preferred bits
7
Lol they are backed by a bank , whatever they do will be win , if not they will be dead after 1080 fiasco
3
"SMALL ONE"... .05 in 67K range?!?! You spent $3,350 and call it small!??!?  That one purchase is more than 50% of all owners will EVER own..
2
Probably because he invested in gold and made 50 bajillion dollars. Gold rally when guys??
2
How much do they owe?  They are currently sitting on roughly $75B worth of coins and cash as their reserves so it would have to be a REALLY big debt to be a problem.
4
This is true, it takes a good bit for trades to settle, you can also only buy or sell during stock market hours.  Both limitations equate to a very crappy platform for day trading per se, but can still make it relatively easy for the weak handed to wreak havoc on any illusion of stability.
2
Chill out jackass
2
Not really, ever it’s off time every so many milliseconds per hour so 💁
1
Not really, I weekly purchased bitcoin +/- 30k for 104 weeks way under today's price.
8
dumb question, maybe i’m just high, but how does / what makes price go up and down? i’ve heard more sellers than buyers = price go down. but if every sale needs a buyer and vice versa then how does that work?
1
The miners always sell and take profit before the final block reward.   I don't think any of this price movement is "normies".   It's literally blackrock buying and now grayscale is selling. Another factor your ignoring here is that this is the first time BTC hit a new ATH BEFORE the halving.    You seem to think it's going to back to 16K.. this tells me you missed your chance to own 1 BTC
9
Post coin.
1
tbf that dumbass lost em in a landfill
1
Was referring more to the amount of BTC. Seems small to me these days, but I'm old. I remember buying in the 100 range. Lol if only I had kept all of those, but I don't know any that did, even though I'm sure some were smart enough to.
1
It's billions, don't know the exact number. Tens of billions in lawsuit fees, they also owe the fed billions due to their backlog of tax debt that accelerated when they lost in court for tax evasion, as well as whatever debt they accrued from the laundering scheme that was exposed a few years ago. It's a massive number, enough to make ripples in the market, the only unknown variable is the extremity of how it will impact things.
4
Or?
1
objectively some really bad things happened.
3
More sellers than buyers results in more buyers, since the price the sellers ask for keeps dropping until it matches what a buyer will pay. So at any one time there can be more sellers than buyers, but eventually it does even out. Sometimes because a buyer buys, sometimes the seller stops being a seller if the price they can sell at goes lower than they are willing to sell for...Of course the opposite scenario follows the same sort of pattern.
1
Lol that poor guy...Every bull cycle i think about him.
3
Not some binance fan, but any sources? I'd like to read about it.

Oh boy I forgot this is Reddit. Enjoy the rest of your day.

Thanks, appreciate the reply. I think my mistake was not making the distinction between an order and an executed trade.
1
Me too, didn’t realise how bad Binance got hammered. It’s kind of amazing they are still going. Wonder what the impact of them folding would be? Coinbase would practically be a monopoly, especially with holding most ETFs. Kind of the Central Bank of crypto, which is 😧
1
You too my friend😁
1
Title: We did it. $69,420
5103
I don't know what app your using but they are overcharging you.
1480
Crypto.com charges massive spread.
372
This is crypto.com so a little inflated but nonetheless
202
There's always someone who calls out the ATH too early.
154
Next up $420,690
104
Just a useful tip when selling on crypto.com DON'T sell to fiat because you will get overcharged. Always do sell swapping and then transfer your funds to an exchange that has low sell fees. Kraken has the lowest-selling fees right now so don't get scammed by crypto.scam
28
Nope, has to be global average price not just 1 exchange lol. Check coinmarketcap for that
117
We’re still 1k off this😂 try a different exchange
38
Lol that's like a $1,000 bid-ask spread
28
Crypto.com dont count.
49
It’s $69,420 somewhere as they say
10
It’s hit $104,000 in Australia in aud obviously
4
Next stop $420,069

Crypto.com is a joke
32
Jfc dude why would you use this platform?

3

3
Lol Binance only $68K 😂
4
We all have to stop buying and selling at the same time to lock it in. It unlocks a secret Bitcoin achievement.
6
Cdc is such a rip off
2
So since Bit coin keeps going up and I’m already up 2k, What if I bought another 2k today and sell it by the end of the day just to make a quick profit
2
It topped at 69,000 dead mate. That 420 is you getting robbed by that platform lol
2
Next stop 80085!
2
Now I'm excited for the downswing...Get ready to BUY BUY BUY!!! :D
2
i watched it hit 70 yesterday
2
It didn’t touch ath lol doesn’t look like its going to just yet either lol.
4
Why is it going up? Explain to me like I’m a dumbass,, wait I am.

Relax guys it's the app, use the defi wallet for cheap fees :) obviously many are not clued up on that yet and still have some to learn. The app is for onboarding people fast :)

Nice! I love the CDC app but the US needs the exchange. It’s also the most regulated exchange that complies with FCC laws. ..I’d rather take a long spread than not be able to sell or withdrawal like other exchanges are doing, no what I’m saying?
1
Bro get a new App and use coinmarketcap.com for pricing
1
Todays the day, I can feel it in my balls
1
Much spread. Very ouch.
1
Nice.

Ask for a refund
1
Nice

man this upsets me. I been getting it weekly for a month now and it has to be at the peak. why the hell was i not doing this for the last 2 years?!  I think ima turn off auto $30 a week on it due to the fact its just way to high. I dont see it making it to 100k but only going down and me losing the little money i got
1
Congratulations from new ATH
1
The beginning of the end

I’ll bet 69,420, didn’t beat CRYPTO.COM ATH ?

Congrats HODLers!!!

You did, too, but you also undid it

Hell yeah, but I thought the highest was like 68,350
1
So many dumb people on here claiming they know more about the crypto world than others…

Send $1000 to my wallet so I can get both the interest and all

We should do another Game Stop. But on crypto. And become mega millionaires.

Hey guys. Where can I learn the basics of this. I have so much debt at 25 and need to learn because everyone seems to be winning in BTC / crypto
1
crypto.com is so overpriced lmao

The fack, the spread on your apps is bigger than my wife 🐶 after my wife boyfriends took care of her

😂😂, he’s getting robbed
357
Yeah the Crypto app shows a higher price than Coinbase
96
lol it’s the spread on cdc they fuck people with their fees and spread
79
Crypto.com app has so massive spread.
16
It's the crap from crypto.com who charges around 10% hidden markup on transactions (and always inflates prices shown too) and calls it "zero fee", but the  fanboys cry "it's just a spread, the cost of convenience" (it's not a spread)
37
Dumb question but how do you see he is getting overcharged ?
6
Hey,.I’m using crypto.com aswell and after the start of the bullrun I noticed how much they charge..Is there anyway to transfer it to another broker? .Or am I now stuck with crypto.com ?
4
How do you know?? How can you tell
3
Absolutely, and when you sell BTC on their app it‘s even sold at 2k less than they show on the charts!
3
Can you tell me the right app to use?!? I wanna get started but have no idea how to invest into crypto tbh
5
Omg I use them too a newbie obviously but what’s a good exchange??
2
He’s using crypto.com the app. Is it a good exchange or not?

"If one simply purchases bitcoin at the price they deserve, how does one get "overcharged" when buying bitcoin" - E. Musk

crypto.com

Crypto.com and yes, yes they do.
1
Yeah Photoshop is rather pricey.
-2
I'll allow the spread for the 69.
95
It's crypto.com and their fees are insane. Not a whole lot of options in the states
5
Can confirm. Only opened an account with them if I ever wanted to sell my Moons. But they would eat away at my profit
10
That’s what she said.
5
They’re just liars, really. I’ve seen less markup on a fucking BTC ATM. “spread” is a few dollars difference not 4%
3
Happy cake day Glum.
9
The only platform I found so far paying 4% APY on BTC
4
How is that joke of an exchange in business? By ripping off their few users like this? They have spent so much money on advertising without the customer base to back it up, I find it so hard to believe they are doing well...Crypto.com is the next ftx. Calling it now.
13
Thank you thank you thank you
8
Robinhood has zero selling fees.  I believe that would qualify them as the lowest.
6
Any time you sell Bitcoin ever you are getting scammed
1
CoinGecko
19
Or at least a major exchange.
12
I still use bitcoinity.org out of habit. It went down the other day and I was really worried it would be gone for good this time.

How does it not look like it will? It’s gunning for the ATH’s within the next 12 hours
1
I'm guessing the ETF has something to do with it.
5
Mouth watering fomo
2
Bitcoin is more interesting than traditional equities so it is beginning to cannibalize everything else.  It's going to be fun.
3
Because the buyers want to buy more than the sellers want to sell.
1
ETFs are releasing more than a decade of pent up demand for a safe easy way to buy BTC, plus crypto hype machine is back on again with memes going 2x to 5x... Strap in, we're in for a crazy ride until halving.
1
Its going up because its near the all time high. Nothing more nothing less.
-4
the cdc defi wallet?
1
Yea if you’re not first you’re last. I knew it was super inflated and wouldn’t get this shot on any other exchange lol

I love this. I literally jinxed it with this intention. Love a nice little discounted sale rate. Just keep buying

Don't sell now. Enjoy the ride!

I would love a discounted rate right now.

A horrible investment? .I bought when bitcoin was under $10k. I added when bitcoin was in the teens, 20s, 30s, 40s, and even in the 50s. That's all history. .Now I'm buying FBTC for trading.

I'm surprised they haven't replied (maybe they sent a dm). They're usually on top of anything negative said about them but you are absolutely correct.
3
The crypto.app shows highs @ 68,841, safepal shows 69,000
4
What’s a spread?
1
ETFs ftw... CEXs have worse exchange rates than airports.
0
Because if you check another exchange that is not the price.
21
The price never came close to that. It still hasn’t touched 69k yet.
11
Transfer to your own wallet ;)
6
Because the price didn't touch 69k on any major exchanges.

If you know someone who has Strike, have them send you a signup link - both of you get $5 free.

Strike is the way 2 go

Strike is great. Or Bisq for decentralized.

Depends where you’re from. US: Strike, Europe: Relai, Asia: ?
2
If you're just getting started there's nothing wrong with coinbase. They're really good for people who are just entering the space. Once you get a little more comfortable though I'd recommend checking out other exchanges. Personally I use Gemini.
1
Don’t use them...They don’t sell $GTTM.

Coinbase and Binance don't work in Hawaii, some of us have to use CDC. Just saying. 🤷

You're not kidding. They charge like .006 BTC for ANY BTC withdraw

80 million is a few users?

If people are paying these inflated prices (they are, and have been for a long time) then I think Crypto.com is probably doing quite well!

Just use the exchange and you are good.

You don’t know what you’re talking about

No one is interested in ETFs. We are talking about Crypto here, not scams🤪

Crypto.com over prices all coins but like 3-5 percent

That doesn't mean OP is buying from this exchange though. Just taking a screenshot
1
Like exodus wallet ? Or should I consider getting a hardware wallet ?

Just went 69K and it's still going (coinbase)

How about Australia?

Gemini is shit. Don’t ever trust those Harvard pricks.

No!!! Don't use them. Just Google them with the word 'review', you'll read some horror stories

I don’t believe that number for a second.

Do you have a provable source?  Even if they did skim to some degree, I find it hard to believe they could pad in excess of the 1-3% standard published fees charged by the other exchanges.  If so tho, it should be highly documented.

Well this is just what I have heard from the past being over 2-3 years ago but I’m sure it remains the same. Keep in mind that they can still call it no fee trades if they earn money from the other Side of it. When you buy and sell does it have a big difference in price? Also I’m sure there must be statements about it somewhere on the internet I just haven’t looked into it because robinhood just isn’t my cup of tea.

About every four years the rewards for mining Bitcoin is halved, meaning it takes longer to get, meaning the value of it should theoretically increase

What are you talking about? BTC was not flat for months after the last block reward halving...The price of bitcoin was **$8,400 on the date of the last block reward halving** which happened **on May 11, 2020**. The price of bitcoin was **$9,900** exactly 1 week later **on May 18, 2020**. That's an 18% increase in the first week after the block reward halving...The price of bitcoin was **$11,300 on July 29, 2020** and 4 days later it reached **$12,000 on Aug 02, 2020**...The price of bitcoin was **$14,000 on October 31, 2020**. ..The price of bitcoin was **$16,460 on Nov 13, 2020** and it reached **$19,400 on Nov 25, 2020**.

Not sure that counts as proof of anything but thanks for offering at least some anecdotal experience.

Great job grabbing near the bottom of the dip BTW.

I'm not a newby, and I do pay attention. EVERY exchange has the spread to contend with, on top of their fees, of which Robinhood does not have any.  In fact, Robinhood has the exact spread, which fluctuates based on trading activity, disclosed on your pre-buy when you prompt your purchase...no fine print required...it is clearly loaded into your bid offer.  I assert that that spread rate is no different than the spread on the other exchanges, there just isn't a fee on top of it.  Since we're all giving advice around here, you need to stop making assumptions about who you are talking to...Straight from their FAQ:."How is Robinhood Crypto commission free? How do you make money?..Robinhood Crypto does not charge commission fees for trading crypto. We do generate revenue through volume rebates from trading venues...For example, for every $100 of notional value for executed crypto orders, Robinhood receives $0.35 in rebates from its trading venues."..Edit: Just worked a mock BTC trade on my Coinbase account and their market price plus up on a $67.4K trading price was more than $68K.  That is a $600 premium.  What was Robinhood''s for same scenario? $214.
1
I don’t think going 68k - 1000k (about 15x) is more impressive then going $0.01 - $68,000 (about… 680,000x). And no, evil bankers aren’t creating nefarious narratives designed to stop people from selling the top, for a person who suggests to give a subject more thought, you seem to have given very little yourself. No one is interested in you (or me) keeping their bitcoin jnstead of selling it.

Yeah but the thing is that due to the halvening the block reward reduces by 50%, this cycle it goes from 12.5 to 6.25 Bitcoin mined every 10 minutes (or so)
0
What you’re saying sounds reasonable enough not to dismiss it out of hand, but it’s wrong. The objective of creating such narrative and keeping people believe in it, even after many previous cicles have shown exactly how it’s going to unfold, isn’t as simple or as effective as you’re trying to make it look. It might work in some small community of 150 people with heavy bags of obscure shitcoin, but it’s not gonna work on a global scale with bitcoin. Also, these people you’re talking about, who want to sell the very top and need to deceive everyone else in the world in order to do it, they have much easier ways to make money, whichever way the price is moving, and they have zero control over how many people are actually believing this lie, the most they can hope with such narrative, is that the price will reach additional 10% before inevitably crashing, and even that 10% is not a given.

Title: 🇸🇻 El Salvador mined 474 Bitcoin worth $29 million using volcano-fueled geothermal power 🤯
4259
  .The Bitcoin was mined with power from the country's Tecapa volcano, using 300 mining processors. Geothermal power generation in Central America has increased nearly fivefold since 1990, with significant growth in El Salvador, which has the second-largest share of geothermal energy generation after Iceland, and in Costa Rica...El Salvador currently produces a quarter of its electricity from geothermal sources and still has considerable untapped potential. Estimates suggest the country has over 600 megawatts of unexploited geothermal resources, which could further expand and strengthen the clean energy portion of its energy matrix.

Their BTC bet has been paying off.

Imagine governments mining bitcoin for revenue instead of taxing their citizens. Im thinking out to the year 2100 where the block reward is insignificant but the aggregate transaction fees are massive because the entire worlds corporations and nation states are using on chain transactions. ..Governments would be able to get paid based on the entire worlds economic activity not just their own citizens, this means it would be counterproductive to slow another nations economy down because that would reduce their overall revenue being earned through mining. Instead all governments would benefit from all other nations doing better and whichever government holds the most hash power will have the largest revenue stream...That would be an amazing world to live in.

Subtract the cost of infrastructure and employee payroll and then you have net profits. I bet it's good and only getting better.

It's fascinating to see how countries are exploring alternative energy sources for Bitcoin mining. Using geothermal power from volcanoes seems like a sustainable way to reduce the carbon footprint associated with mining. I wonder how this model could influence other countries to adopt similar approaches?

Does anybody really think and I’m asking a simple honest question, WITH RESPECT. I’m not trying to pick on anybody or make fun of anybody or put down any group of people. I promise you that. Do you Understand that bitcoin is a made up value not based on anything, not valued like the normal currency market and a central bank? Do you know that bitcoin doesn’t do anything? it just sits there to be bought and sold. It’s not a corporation, it’s not a product, with employees, it’s just an invisible coin that you can’t touch or feel, that you’ll say, it’s worth …. X , just because. Please enlighten me.  I’m asking respectfully to please enlighten me.

We don't know how much they paid for the mining equipment though. And the volcano power-plant wasn't free either. So of that $29 million, we don't know how much is actually profit. It could still be a net loss of some $100 million at this point.

Doubt it. A trillion dollars buys a heck of a lot more bitcoin for the next 5+ years than El Salvador will ever be able to accumulate.  .. You need every major power to continuously fuck ip for a long time before El Salvador becomes “one of the wealthiest” countries. ..Bitcoin is a better store of value than the US dollar but the US dollar is still going to take a long time to go to 0.

It's a 102 MW power plant, of which 1% is dedicated to bitcoin mining, the further 99% is dedicated to the energy needs of the citizenry.

I can agree with that to an extent, but I personally believe they aren't necessarily in a deficit on this thinking long term. I would be interested to know the daily cost to run and total construction costs for augments sake.

I couldn’t find any solid numbers for cost per day or original construction costs.
1
You have to view this in a "stranded energy" cost perspective. Stranded energy is energy produced which has nowhere to go for various reasons. It can easily be a combination of lower demand and energy storage availability...As a quick example: let's say they're producing 100MW of power, but the current demand is only at 60MW, and all energy storage (batteries?) are fully charged. In a typical power plant setup, the 40MW goes to waste, and they ramp down production to be just above the demand level since they can't sell it anyway. If they use that excess 40MW to mine bitcoin, then sell the bitcoin, they can effectively still maintain production "revenue". In this example, instead of just getting 60MW worth of energy revenue, they can take advantage of the total 100MW production by selling the bitcoin mined by the excess. Considering that they don't have to purchase any kind of fuel to operate the power plant, their BTC production/mining costs are mostly composed of the cost of the mining rigs...Note that they are effectively mining "for free".
1
 Govt is just a collection of individuals. ..By building this they sacrificed investing elsewhere.
8
There is also operational costs cooling costs, salaries, that need to be paid. I highly doubt they will break even, even with the cost of the hardware and running costs alone. BTC mining profits are at record lows and the only way miners make money is by holding the BTC instead of selling it. Considering how little power they generate I would imagine it's quite a small mining setup so I would be surprised if overall they are coming out positive from paying of the loans on the machines, salaries and cooling.

Likely a private-public partnership where Ecuador provides the power plant, and a Bitcoin mining fund from the US provides the mining technology, they split the profits (or even, they sell the electricity at a discount for the partnership).
1
Why does it have to be repaid before they are in the black?..You can rent miners you know?..I wouldn't be surprised to find out someone else lent them the money with the expectation to get it back when they are on sold or reach EOL...Again you're not understanding the accounting treatment of expenses.
1
How about some numbers rather than beliefs
2
Still even if it's free it barely pays for the maintenance costs, salary and cooling infrastructure for the mining rigs. Much better to just buy BTC instead of buying shitty hardware that will be obsolete in a year and that ant has already mined with by ant for a year before you got it.
1
Except we don’t know what else they get in revenue for providing power to the grid. They are connected to several municipalities.
14
Would be interesting to know what the annual ROI is compared to something like oil, which would probably have a bunch of costs associated with distribution etc. and would likely put on pressure to do trade in USD. In this way they can export their energy products with less overhead, I wonder how they compare.
1
Irrelevant because they could have bought 29mil of Bitcoin instead. Only the present value matters for mining.

Your way of thinking really only applies to mining rigs running off of paid energy. I don't know if you are aware of how much of the cost of running a mining operation is due to energy/electricity consumption...While agree with you that outright buying BTC is better than investing in a mining operation in a paid energy scenario, it's the total inverse in a free energy scenario. Think about it: given 2 mining operations with the exact same hardware and operating costs, same everything. The only difference is that one needs to pay for energy/electricity consumption and the other doesn't. It's a night and day difference in terms of net operational costs and profits.
1
That geothermal plant was built about 10 years ago. They are using excess energy to mine bitcoin. The 1 billion loan which el salvador has not received yet will be used ro build bitcoin city at another location. Search Bitcoin city El salvador and you will get a better idea of what's to come.

Penis reduction surgery. It’s $1000 per inch.

It can be use to protect the vulnerable ones from scams such as the Indian Microsoft/Amazon gift card scams.
5
That’s why bitcoin is the way
3
Funny, yes, but I'm pretty sure (and am increasingly confiden based on the tellers' responses) they're asking because they want to make sure you're not getting scammed. They don't care what you're spending it on (evidently), they're just making sure you don't say "My girlfriend in Nigeria needs me to send it to her" or "A friend needs me to buy them iTunes gift cards".
3
It looks like you can say just about everything and still get your money. For now.....The fact that they even ask you this is absolutely mind-blowing to me. Totally not worrisome and shouldn't raise any red flags with the masses, nope. Just be a good NPC and keep putting your savings there. Nothing could possibly go wrong once shit *truly* hits the fan...
3
9 times out of 10, it’s someone getting scammed and sending money to Nigeria or India.  This one time it might be reasonable...Tell them you’re buying steam gift cards for your Nigerian prince and they’ll leave you alone.

I'll play devil's (lettuce) advocate: this may be an attempt to prevent fraud.

I always say straight to the casino or cocaine and hookers. I like the butt hole bleach and transistion answer however for the future. makes me want to pull out 10k tomorrow just to say that. lol
2
i've never had a bank teller ask me what I'm doing with my money
2
Lmao!.Bleaching my asshole. Three shades lighter. Brilliant!
2
They didn’t ask when I was putting it into their bank why now? As the bank was using my money to make more for themselves while I get NOTHING
2
i hope my bank in the philippines asks me this so i can say i wanna bleach my asshole and use laser hair removal for the hairs in my asshole
2
The sad part is joking around will cause some government agency to start monitoring you
2
“Whatever you do is your business.”..Said the person literally asking “why are you withdrawing this money?”
2
That would be none of your business?
2
Say it’s for crypto and they will block it
2
I always tell them that I’m going to throw it on my bed and roll in it. Never any follow up questions. Gets me in and out quickly.
2
I'm glad in America banks don't ask you what you're gonna do with your money
2
The correct answer is "I am starting my own bank"
2
"Bro said he could get it up to 3 shades lighter"..TELL ME YOUR ASSHOLE BLEACHER'S NUMBER
2
Telling medical info makes me wonder if those questions might be considered illegal. They are putting your medical info into a database.
2
What kind of stupid rule is that? Like they are going to catch criminals because they asked. .."Why are you withdrawing?".."For finance a bank heist I'm planning. DOH! You got me!"
2
Bank asks for 2 reasons:..- Make sure you are not getting scam (happens A LOT)..- After a certain amount, we are required to send a report (If we send a report that you are trying to get money below on purpose not to get send a report then you will really get investigated) ..But,  go ahead and lie. We do not care tbh just don't cry if your account gets closed
2
Because if they don’t ask and you get scammed and lose all your money for being a fucking idiot then they’re liable.
2
This is fucking AWESOME!😂🤣😭👏🙌
2
Tellers need to ask this question in order to complete the transaction… say something false but don’t be a dick to someone doing their job

If only they had machines that let you take out money without having to talk to a person, like an automated teller or something...Or if you could only send money electronically without having to give a reason for why on a plethora of banking sites or personal payment apps...But yeah bitcoin is the solution to this, for sure.

That's why it just better to slowly remove cash out overtime. Never know when thr banks will just take what you have left. It's also why CBDCs are being worked on...to remove paper money.

Banks in the Netherlands no longer give you cash. They do not even have ATM machines anymore. If you want cash you need to drive to somewhere else where thos third party ATM machines give you very limited amounts of cash.

People fail to understand that If you deposit the money in the bank you are actually lending to the bank. Is not your money anymore, its theirs...If you want to deposit money in the bank while keeping It as "your money", you have to put cash inside a deposit box, like a vault, and their Will be fees for that...This difference of ownership most people fail to understand
1
What if you just tell them it’s none of their business. What happens?  Do they refuse to give you your money?  How is this even a thing? What business is it if theirs, proof by this video that it shouldn’t be asked at all.

Since when is it a bank tellers business what you spend your money on? I could see if you are elderly and suddenly withdrawing $300K in cash...There is a chance you are a scam victim. But otherwise GFYS with the questions. ..I would just say “none of your businesses. I would like my money please.”

Banks ask this because Olds will sometimes tell them it's for gift cards or other scammed related prompts.  They get offered assistance.  Because when they realize they're scammed then the bank is the first to hear the story and somehow get it back.
1
"I'm going to spread it out on my bed and roll around naked in it. I'll bring it back in tomorrow to re-deposit it. Are you working tomorrow?"

Bank maybe asking to make sure you aren’t getting scammed. ..Western Union asks the same questions when transferring money
1
Do they not realize that people are just going to make up ridiculous shit? I guess the next step would be to find a way to find out if they're telling the truth, that'll be the justification for their next phase of increased surveillance.

Tell them you need to go buy apple gift cards so you pay a large tax bill you just realized you owe.  See if they even care to even help you from getting scammed.

Nice for future

You give the bank money to safeguard for you so asking why you want it isn’t a bad question to ask as a lot of people take large sums of money out irregularly because they are victims of scams. By asking they can potentially guide against sending money to scammers.

I had same question thrust in my face when transferring money on line... They rejected the transfer. ..They also wanted to know what is the money for. ..They lectured me about crypto currency, scams etc. I told that person I am well educated, done my research and know what I’m doing and also  why? Also have been doing same transactions since 2017... So why the fuss now? ..I was irate that the questions were more than just offensive, but breached privacy laws... It’s not their business to question how I use “my” money. …Well we know that banks consider your money as their money. That’s why we need crypto!!!..This guy who goes to the bank teller takes it to another level. And Raises an interesting question. ..He’s taking out cash - not transferring to a registered and certified crypto exchange. So why ask? ..Is he being profiled? - if so this is discriminatory, and in breach of Australian anti discrimination laws. ..The Comm bank better watch out. I can see ICAC getting involved - yet again. This is overreach. ..Let’s not forget… the Comm Bank (Australia’s biggest bank) recently breached anti money laundering reporting laws on more than 10,000 occasions. Each event incurring finial penalties in the $100,000s. The the bank the accumulative punitive penalty was a mere slap on the wrist. ..Talk about hypocrisy??? ..Good on this guy for exposing this shameful practice. ..shame on the Comm Bank.

Pretty much. That or sending him gift cards. Worked as a teller. Had to ask over certain amounts. Everybody lies and I personally didn't care unless someone made it sound like they were getting scammed or conned. At that point I am obligated both by the bank and by my personal ethics to try to help that person avoid getting scammed. Other than that you're welcome to buy all the coca cola you're heart desires or can handle. Fuck it I'm on lunch in 20

Tell me they are looking for Nigerian Primce without telling me
1
why would they ask you what you doing with your own money?
6
They don’t care why, they do nothing with the information. They ask and if you say it’s because  the IRS, is going to put me in jail or else. They will tell you it’s a scam. They aren’t going to tell you that your excuse is not good enough. Not one of his crazy reasons was he denied his money
136
Yeah and when the bank doesn't ask questions and some grandma sends 5k to some Nigerian prince people get mad at the bank for not asking questions...Damned if you do damned if you don't eh?
22
O stop. You don't think banks aren't funding shady shit? They don't care about your drugs or weapons, or felonies. They care about liability. Almost every inconvenience you face is about liability. It's just so they can tell the cops they asked when your stack of cash ends up at a Crack den with the bank slip in there.
13
Finally someone that said something wise!.This shouldn’t be laughing matter, this is something that in the past pushed for a revolution 🤷‍♂️

What is scary? Just make up something who cares. I haven’t done a cash withdraw in years

Probably that’s the answer.

That's correct, this is just an Australian bank complying with fraud and corruption regulations...It sounds stupid but if you're a mule you run out of excuses after the 500th time they ask you.

none of what you said is true though...

Juat get a smart phone and use online banking. Damn. Not the banks fault if you aren't smart with money 😂
-1
I mean that's why Bitcoin. The miners care not who you are or what you plan to do. You pay the fee and the funds are moved. No questions asked.
7
For amounts like this, it's mainly to protect the customer. They want to make sure you're not being scammed or anything of that nature. They genuinely couldn't give a flying fuck what you use it for. ..Larger amounts, they're required by law to ask the purpose etc for anti money laundering regulations set by the government etc. ..Source - worked for a major UK bank
3
Until you get scammed out of your hard earn money, then the first thing the customer do it's come back to the bank. "Why didn't you protect me?" it's crazy that people want it both ways
-1
My mother-in-law texted me from the bank parking lot. She was 'supposed' to wire $10,000 to pay back an account that had 'accidentally been credited to her account'. She didn't get inside the bank, but I'd like to think that a teller would have asked a few questions if she got to that point. Afterwards, we sat down and had a few discussions about scams.
3
I am not a bank lover by any means but the greeter asking you why you there is literally so they can direct you to the right person lol, can’t really hate on that. As for your CD issue, you can open a brokerage account and buy/sell CDs yourself without having to go to the bank, also when you do that you have access to third party CDs, not just that specific bank’s CDs
7
My bank is the same way.  I think they do it so they can just talk you into rolling it all into a new CD.  They don’t want you to withdraw it.  They want you to keep it in their bank as long as possible.
9
I left that bank the day they enacted that.
1
which bank doesn't do that currently? I'm looking to move

Or it could be to help a victim from a robbery or scam. Grandma walks in and says she needs to buy $100k for gift cards to help her poor friend on Tindergram.

HIPPA laws basically only apply to the medical industry.  There are some exceptions, but for example if you told me you had cancer, I could tell whoever I want you have cancer and it'd be legal.
1
Why does tellers need to ask is australia?  I can pull $100k here in USA and tellers won't say anything.
2
Re-deposit the money and pull it out at another branch
1
really? even if its not fraud, people still do 'stupid' stuff with money. this seems more like banks protecting themselves from potential fraud claims
1
Yes, the bank can decide whether or not to allow you to withdraw cash from your account. They can absolutely say "No", and you agreed to give them that power when you opened the account.
1
It’s a private bank.
1
It's to help elderly people not get scammed.  It's overall a good thing.
1
if you don't care, why ask it like its just a personal off-the-cuff thought? why not say "for compliance reasons, i'm obligated to ask why you're withdrawing this"
2
Why do you “have” to ask?  Anyone ever just say ya know what, never mind… and not withdraw? Have you ever had to refuse someone based on their answer?..I had a teller yell across the lobby… “What brings you in today?”..“Deposit…”..“How much will you be depositing with us?”..Look around at the other folks in the lobby… “5…”..“5 hundred?”..“No, $5K”..During the transaction I decided to just cash it.  ..“What do you need 5k for?”..“Buying a trailer off of Craigslist and this is my budget…”..I considered closing my account (B of A).  Are we being trained to have bankers all up in our shit?  Seems odd… like a policy just to get people used to having their money tied directly to what they are buying and have it reported...Next time, I told them I wanted to roll in it…

how are you going to get 6K out of an ATM?

It's Australia, and if he asked for $10,000 or more, they have to mandatorily fill in an AUSTRAC form and send the info to the government. At $6,000, the tellers' script is asking them to ask, but they aren't doing much with the info
31
Canadian here. They always ask. I'm tired of banks' scumfuckery so I always answered "because it's mine and I want it" and they wouldn't push it. ..I always got the impression it was to push services, not because they had to. Always followed up with "we see you have a large balance, can we set you an appointment with our financial advisors?" ... No asshole, I've been saving up for the thing I need all this cash for and didn't want to tell you about that either. ..Spoiler alert, I was paying our contractor about half under the table. Took out about $60k cash over a period of 6 months, got really irritated and the huge fuss they'd kick up over like $5k. Once they took me to a back room with a witness to count it with me. Then they went back to screwing poor people with overdraft fees.
29
It does. We withdrew $7,500 and the first thing the bank asked is what is the money for. We needed to buy a used farm machinery. Many farmers don't like check.

He says Australia in the video

Almost pissed myself when he said that.
10
So you’re saying these questions are actually to prevent old pensioners from being scammed out of their life savings by fraudsters?
3
Because you're taking away their chance to play with your cash as if it was theirs.
16
While I completely disagree with them asking private questions about how someone is using their money, the reason is that they are trying to prevent people from getting ripped off by fraudsters. Many elderly people are asked to take out cash and then buy gift cards or the like to "pay their tax bill" or worse, being intimidated into giving cash. It's trying to catch the fraud before it happens. ..I'd be interested to know how many crimes it has prevented. I suppose if it has saved a few people's life-savings, then it's worth asking the question but it should also be stated by the bank teller that the person is not legally obliged to answer the question.
9
To determine if client is sending it to Nigerian prince or is doing so under threat. It's to prevent scams
3
>why would they ask you what you doing with your own money?..The banks own you, and treat you like property...There is no other reason...We like in bank corporate socialism and the bank owners are the ruling noble class, the politicians are their soldiers, and everyone else is a slave serf.
1
After 9/11, there were regulations put in place for "know your customer" (kyc) and aml (anit-money laundering) in which any transactions over $3000 is recorded in a report and sent off to the agencies
1
He should have done a couple where he tells them he is gonna buy Bitcoin just for comparison.
19
I like the one where he says summer's coming up, music festivals, and he needs it for steroids and the teller just says 'I understand.'
13
Well... that actually seems like a *good* thing.
39
>They aren’t going to tell you that your excuse is not good enough...Yes they are. I was denied a withdrawal request at this exact same bank, Commonwealth Bank, at a different branch, because I answered that I was making a Tik-Tok video of how much money could flush down the toilet.  Went to a different branch and got my money out no problem, after giving a 'better' excuse.
5
Thank you! Worked as a teller for a handful of years. Anything over a few thousand that's abnormal, you'd just make conversation and make sure it's nothing crazy. I've stopped a handful of scams, it's really sad hearing from people that were scammed. They don't care at all. If you really don't want to say, just make up something. You're buying a car, whatever.

The IRS, in Australia? ..Also those scammers coach people with how to answer questions from the bank.

I am not worried about anything in particular but about the general principle. This in theory enables something like Social Credit System, where you can get points for whatever you do. Like you buy alcohol, your score goes down, etc... Though this in particular doesn't enable it, for it there would need to be more surveillance of every purchase. But it is a step in that direction.
-1
this is exactly the answer. and even then, they can't refuse. they make you sign a waiver that says "i'm a big dumbass that's being defrauded of my money and the bank tried to inform me but i'm doing it anyway hurr durr"..there's a few posts about elderly or gullible people withdrawing hundreds of thousands of dollars and their children being pissed at the bank for letting them

Indeed. Imagine signing a waiver at a skydiving centre and then being like "duuur, I can jump off the roof for free without all this BS"....I mean, go ahead big man...??
2
and how the fuck bank will protect customer from getting scammed ? just asking why you need money for? Lmao .I think I like in a joke
1
Yep, they pitched me other assets and went over interest rates, and all I could think was "ally bank savings has better rates and I'm not locked into a contract for a minimum time"

>They don’t want you to withdraw it. They want you to keep it in their bank as long as possible...[Fractional Reserve Banking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp)..They don’t even keep your money (only 10%), they loan out 90% and collect the interest off YOUR money. ..BuT aT lEaSt ThEy GiVe YoU .5% iNtErEsT oN sAvInGs 🥴..That’s why they’ll make it a pain-in-the-ass for you to take large amounts out. Scam protection is just how they convince us to go along with it.

Swings and roundabouts.
2
ING bank are much better, I moved over to them and they dont do anything like that
2
....thats preventing fraud.
2
 I assume it’s the same for both countries but Ive been a teller here in America. Banks need to do a CTR (currency transaction report) for cash withdrawals above 10k which then they will ask for an occupation to put down in order to move on and withdraw funds. You can tell them anything but it needs to be asked. This is to help prevent laundering. This is if you pull out straight cash, never asked for cashiers checks or wires
1
It is, it’s so that the bank can show they made every effort to prevent fraud. If the bank asks you if you’re at risk of being defrauded by making the withdrawal and you say no then they have little accountability should you go on to experience a financial loss
1
Yeah, I am here in America and that would not fly here. I have a right to my own money, no matter what the reason...Thanks for explaining.
1
It’s my fucking money and it is none of their goddamn business.
0
idk im not american . is there limit of how much you can withdraw per day? ..in my country it is equivalent to like $1000 per day . just do it for like 6 days lmao

1
As said, it's a famous Simpson's quote. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB3H33ARY9g
3
They need to bump those numbers. Bleaching my asshole ain’t cheap anymore because inflation. They aren’t going to want to see my forms every week.
13
Alright so it makes sense. So it’s in line with any other banking system. Any large amount withdrawals will automatically trigger such inquiries for tracking purposes...People with different motives try to keep these withdrawals under these legal limits so as not to trigger such inquiries or tracking...Not optimal, but it’s what it is.
-2
Canadian here as well, that 5K limit is the most absurd thing but I am surprised they never asked me this.
3
Not sure about canada, but there is a thing called structuring. Its done to commit financial crimes and money laundering. Its when someone makes transactions intentionally splitting larger amounts into smaller sums to avoid the compliance obligations of the bank (currency transaction report). If you try to do this you’ll get an unusual activity report sent right to fincen.
3
privatize the gains, socialize the losses
1
This is about money laundering, not consumer protection.
7
Yeah, I totally though he was going to say that on a bitcoin post
12
I thought that’s what was gonna happen tbh
3
I worked as a bank teller, if someone was taking CASH and said they were going to buy Bitcoin, that'd be a bit of a red flag. I'm not super into crypto but it seems like the crypto ATMS are a huge ripoff and not recommended. I'd definitely ask more questions like if someone was telling them to buy it or if they were buying it for the first time. If they said it was a regular thing they do, that's fine.
1
Haha, teller wishes he had money for roids
3
Aaaaaaand ..Press X to doubt
0
If you were really going to see how much money you were flushing down the toilet, then they did you a favor. LMAO
-2
Thanks! It was my friend who was a teller told me the same thing. He stopped some grandma who was sending it to a nephew in Mexico to get them out of jail. Nephew was fine and not in jail and not in Mexico and she never thought about calling the nephew on their cell.
1
It’s to prevent scammers in general not just the IRS. It is also to catch fraud, money laundering, etc. ..Yes, I’m sure some scammers have things in place to coach people. But helping a little portion of the population is better than helping 0...But I don’t think this video proved much, the tellers didn’t end up caring anyways. One lady said she asks because “I have to ask”.
10
Well Nigerian prince , or to pay “Microsoft “ to unlock your computer or whatever. A lot of people get scammed and it starts with getting cash from a bank
3
No it doesn't. These are banks. Ironically banks already have a social credit system. It's called your credit score. They don't care about how many hookers you fuck. ..You're thinking of government backed surveillance. Which has almost nothing to do with private companies covering their own ass. ..You sound like a fox news robot.
2
> this is exactly the answer. and even then, they can't refuse. they make you sign a waiver that says "i'm a big dumbass that's being defrauded of my money and the bank tried to inform me but i'm doing it anyway hurr durr"..> there's a few posts about elderly or gullible people withdrawing hundreds of thousands of dollars and their children being pissed at the bank for letting them..This happened to a friend of mine's 80 years old grandma.  Family tried to stop her, bank tried to stop her, and she was then coached by the scammers on what to say to force the bank to accept it.    Lost entire bank account around $300k wiring it away to scammers.
20
I just keeping changing my mind. back and forth.
1
We would be looking for anything odd as an answer. Oh it's to pay a bill I didn't realise I had, they're going to send me to jail otherwise. ..Or, oh it's to buy apple gift cards to pay my tax bill. ..Stupid shit like that. It's not as dumb as you think
1
Customer: " I'm withdrawing to send to Nigeria to help someone"..Bank: "You are being scammed"..Customer: "Oh, thank you."..Not a super difficult concept.
1
Which is a perfectly valid response. "I'm not interested because your competitors offerings are more attractive." That's how the majority of industries work.   I swear you guys act like you've just discovered adulthood and money with some of your replies on here...
1
Oh it's worse than that. Your info is a little out of date. Most western countries have a 0% reserve requirement. They can loan it all out, they don't have to keep anything.
2
TY!
1
I was describing the banking system in the United States. You should probably read the documents you signed when opening your bank account...Also, Civil Asset Forfeiture is a thing in the US, which is another fun way to take your money away from you, without any shred of evidence indicating that you've committed a crime. Like the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, the Fourth Amendment has had a great number of holes poked in it in the last two centuries.

It’s 5k in the UK too
3
Money laundering involves money coming in, not money going out. Once the money hits your account in any large amount (or series of small amounts), the government knows about it and they can start investigating if there are any suspicions. No money launderer is going to tell the bank that they're committing crimes.
5
And why the hell would you care what they do with their own money?
1
Yeah, no one who holds any crypto ever got scammed with absolutely zero recourse.
11
Yup this was one of the same I stopped too. Grandson sent a pregnant woman to the hospital in a car accident and grandma came in to take out a bunch of cash for a bail bondsman. She insisted she talked directly to her grandson and knew it was his voice. After finally convincing her to call him or her son (kids father) he was home, playing video games.
2
That’s not for your protection, or citizens protection. Asking a privacy invasive question is not going to prevent any fraud, ever..They are testing how far they can stretch their tentacles 🦑 of power grabbing. Eventually we all going to loose any bit of freedom we have. At the end, we will own nothing, and be forced to be happy about it. Big daddy will command us how to live, and if you disobey, oh well, they will wipe you off the face of earth..This shouldn’t be an acceptable procedure at all. It’s your money, until caught doing illegal business with them, they have no right to violate your privacy.
2
Because professional money launderers will be honest with the bank teller 😂
1
What about truckers in Canada whose accounts were blocked just because they were protesting?
6
Jfc, sorry for your grandma. What was the scam exactly?
4
Which goes to show how useless the questioning is.
1
Wow, I didn't know bank cares about theirs customer actually....this never happened to me😂
1
Oh shit, you’re right… [Link for others.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-isn-t-the-federal-reserve-requiring-banks-to-hold-depositors-cash)..>The Federal Reserve Board reduced banking reserve requirements to zero in March 2020. Since that time, banks in the United States have not been required to actually hold any depositor money in the bank, making a flawed system — fractional reserve banking — worse. ..> Zero reserve policies at the Federal Reserve only make further bank collapses more likely...I knew the Federal Reserve was evil, but I thought they only wanted to enslave us… I didn’t know they were actually trying to cause a collapse. ..For the Great Reset eh?
1
The cops have been using it to prosecute for years. Without a trial or jury. Straight to jail. This is why I’d have most of my money in stocks and crypto.
1
Recturns
1
Nah. For anything under 10k, it's just scripted. Helps avoid customers being scammed etc, and covers the banks liability. They couldn't really give a fuck about what you do with it. ..Over 10k it's noted for anti money laundering.
0
yup, it is to prevent fraud, my grandma got saved by tellers when she got a call from a scammer pretending to be me who said I was in jail in Costa Rica or something. The teller was like, yeah, why don't you call someone first to confirm this...She has never told me how much she was willing to pay to bail me out of jail though. It would be nice info to have.
3
I don't care what they do. I do however want to stop them from being scammed. The same people that complain about stuff like this come right into the bank demanding the bank give them money for their own mistakes. More than $10 Billion was given to scammers last year. When I was a teller, I'd do my part to help stop that. We constantly got trained to spot scams and help stop things like elder abuse. It was part of my job to help protect people.
2
Well that's Canada...would never happen in <insert your country> /s
5
Did the government do that? Or was it a private company showing their ass? Because there is a difference. You are whinning about state sanctioned surveillance and at the same time whinning about private companies. I don't know a lot about Canada. Is it the bank owned by the government? ..Are you for fee market capitalism? Because companies choosing what to do with their customers falls more in line with that than 1984 government conspiracies.
1
It was something where she thought she was being targeted by fraud and the scammers were helping her.  They had control of her computer for almost a year and had "gotten rid of viruses" multiple times to gain trust. ..It was a long con and their family even contacted the bank and said don't let her send money out and she was still able to do it eventually.  ..Her family was in the process of removing her ability to control finances but it was too late.
12
The questioning is for the bank to release themselves from liability, not to help the client.
4
Probably because you dont have the money for them to ask these questions.

5k IS under 10k sooo yeah 🤷‍♂️

Banks caring about people, huh? Doesn't add up.

2
Don't confuse the company with the individuals that work there. I also worked for a smaller bank but, I'm sure bigger bank tellers get very similar training.
2
I mean, if that came out from your personal duty of care, then that's applaudable. But in my opinion banks don't give a damn about inviduals and just want to control the money

1
You mean Morgan Stanley and Black Rock and Wall Street hedge funds did it. All you can see is the valuation in USD. The entire point was to have digital gold that wasn't controlled by the centralized financial elites. They just bought enough BTC to control the price. We lost.

It’s not a simulation. It’s because state issued trashcoins go towards zero. All physically linked things go up in value because infinitely created crap goes to zero.

The Whales made a BIG BIG mistake selling at ATH $69k to the Institutions...The Whales are expecting a drop to $62k next week to buy back in.  ..Ain't going to happen ... the institutions will gobble it all up.  ..Tired of these Whales controlling BTC price for us little retailers .....F--k the Whales .  ..The Whales will be buying back in next week ... we will see $75k within a month ...

Bro i had the craziest shit happen to me man. I had 60k in the last bullrun then everything went down and i only had 23k left then i invested 3 k in forex and in a year i was back to 45k but then i had to big lotsize shorts open on gold before the new year it was 2022 bout to be 2023 and when trading reopend i was in crazy floating loss but then i was even 2-3k in profit on the trades but before i could even close all trades i got margin called and lost every penny i had earned in my forex journey. Then all i had left was 20k and i was to scared to buy back btc and i swear to god it was the exact moment btc was at 15k and i was literally only building the forex stack to be able to buy back btc. But i before i could i got margin called in minutes so yeah i could have had 3 btc. Still kicking my self everyday for that horrible trading decision. Normally i always go small lotsizes and the worst that happen was 8k floating loss but everytime i ended up closes the trades in profit and that’s how i was able to profit so much but that one day i fucking slipped up and had huge lot sizes.

Very few you mean? I've never net anyone but you who's been able to hold that long. But that's good stuff, I'd sell today if I was you. Never go broke taking profits. I believe in it but I think way higher prices are years out

brother you just need to hold, trading bitcoin is a dangerous game

That sucks bro, wished you took profit during the last bull run or at least scoop up some other crypto during the year of red (2022) and waited till things started going back up but it was hard to do that with the SEC fuckery from 2022 and 2023. I thank God I invested 4k of my own money into the bear market hoping to double my invest but I tripped it and now I’m just waiting for the top in 2025 then imma start selling all the way into 2026 and buy in the bear market. I want to make at least 100k and be able to own half a bitcoin by 2026. This just the beginning of the bull run so you can definitely still make some gains, I wish you luck though man and Godspeed.

You might prove to be right in the short term, but no one’s lost money who’s held either. I certainly haven’t. ..Regardless, the original post was just made to point and laugh at funny numbers, 420 and 69.

Tbh pitching is legendary, but the price is so high that the returns it used to have is over, even if it rips to 200k that's only another 100%. It'll probably go to a million in years but even so you'd still outperform that at 10% a year in the S&P so I mean.

Title: We’re chillin at 73k if you haven’t noticed…😁
3814
This is wild. ..This is exactly how it feels like. ..Where is everyone? Where's the party?
414
The amount of trauma folks went through in 2022.. every one is in the zen state right now. It goes up well. Stays flat good. Goes down I buy more. Nothing to it anything other that. Imo.
662
It’s because everyone knows what the potential is. When we see 100k we can celebrate
70
Just wait till it hits 200k
113
Last time, line went up because retail traders were buying with extra money in their checking account. This time, investors are allocating a small percent of their portfolio to Bitcoin. The line going up is MUCH more healthy this time around. ..See you at 100k soon friends.
54
What does that tell you? We are still very far away from the next ATH
49
I'm so used to my coins going up and down, I feel numb at bitcoins ath. If it hit like 100k then I will party.
23
I feel nothing. So numb from previous years cycles.
16
Next time it dips to $5k, I'm filling my bag.
17
My soul is calloused..
13
What was the previous all time high before 69k ?
24
In all fairness, people were celebrating 69k becuase it was the FIRST time it hit it after going down to 8k. Thats an x8 increase. Currently its sitting at only a x4.5 from 16000. So if math serves me, people will be celebrating once it hits 120k and not a moment before. Thats when the real party starts. This just sits at a simple retracing to the previous high...People werent celebrating when it retraced back to 20k in 2020 either. It wasnt until 60k did people start going wild.
85
Personally for me, even tho we are at an all time high.. i think its undervalued. I dont even feel bad continuing to buy
19
JUST IN: 🇹🇭 Thailand to allow institutions and high net worth investors access U.S. spot #Bitcoin  ETFs - Bangkok Post.Should help BTC ETF and BTC much higher.
9
Every single person who has ever bought and held BTC is in profit. Now we ride off to 100k and beyond.

Insert MOAR GIF

Still Quiet before the fomo storm.  I like it right here for a little while longer…

69k in 2021 would be worth like 79k today. IMO we ain't seen nothing yet. Anyone paperhanding this fake ATH gonna regret it, sooner rather than later.
6
Its been 3 years? Dang
5
73 isn't quite as sexy though is it?!
4
69k was more than triple the previous ATH. If we go to 210k believe me there will be parties
3
I just sold 20% of my btc holdings today. Feeling really good about it. Already Reinvested 5% of that. Ppl might say that was a dumb move but having that cash on hand right now makes me feel like a small weight has lifted
7
[supprimé]
13
Remember that when the ATH was broken last cycle it was similar to this breaking ATH. Exuberance will start 100k this cycle
3
The hodlers are hardened
3
100k will definitely be the point where the party starts for the masses.
3
It’s technically not that close to it’s 2021 ATH value-wise though. Even though the absolute number of the value is higher, due to inflation we’d need to reach closer to 82k just to be equal with 2021’s ATH when it comes to true value of a single bitcoin, 14% inflation since then.
3
I'm not chilling, I want it to have a small correction so my limit orders get triggered and I get it a bit cheaper before hell breaks loose
3
To be honest, 69k in 2021 probably gave you bigger purchasing power than 73k at this moment
2
People will get excited again when it hits 420k
2
hype hasn't even started this shit is going to explode
2
This is just the pre party
2
Where’s all the memes!!???
2
At what point in the cycle do y’all think there will be a drawback? Before halving/after halving and by how much?
2
Yeah $20k vibes last bull run. Sitting at all time high and no one really giving a fuck.
2
It also feels like memes died at some point.. maybe it was when the influencers began trying to become memes to increase engagement...I really only see memes in the circlejerk subs but maybe my experience doesn’t fully extrapolate.
2
Just another Wednesday.
2
there’s no party because—..1) difficulty at all time highs… like way high… miners were struggling at 35k and at 73 its okay for now but when the halving happens they’ll be at break even again…..2) this run up is 5 months too early… this is not the bull market everyone expected… it’s WAY. TO. SOON...3) asics are a derivative of btc and priced accordingly..  the hong kong spot price for asics is higher than the may/June delivery… meaning the ASICS mfgrs anticipate a pullback..4) every cycle in the past, chinese miners were the majority cohort.. they acted as one… plugging new asics as one (before all) selling as one into the pre-halving run.. since the chinese miner ban and mass exodus, America is now the major cohort. Americans are cowboys, they dont collaborate with their peers, they act as singletons.. no miners are selling their stacks as one anymore… so the market never got the massive pre halving dump..5) most American miners are all debt financed and so their economics are all skewed by debt now… this has pushed their effective cost to produce a bitcoin much lower than in previous cycles on a relative basis, but it is a debt fiction. we will see how it plays out..So everyone is fomoing in right now and looking around like where’s the party; could be the calm before the storm of a massive retrace, we haven’t had a real selloff for a long time..Disclaimer: btc is a wild beast and could keep going up, but it would be bucking trends if it did so
2
You just had to say something
2
I sold everything. Think it’ll go down before it comes back up
2
Ill party with you at 250k this autumn.
2
So annoying. I heard about bitcoin very early on and if I realised you could buy it I would have done. Last year I saw that the price had fallen a lot and I've been meaning to buy. Just my luck that I've missed out again
2
Cuz it ain’t done
2
Bunch of losers waiting for a miracle
2
Not anymore… woke up to 67k this morning
2
Narrator:  They were in fact not chilling at 73k…
2
I like this meme
2
Just bitcoin things
2
do you honestly not get why this is an uneven comparison?  .bitcoin breaking 69k would be met with the same attitude as when it broke 20k and kicked off the last rally. Or when it broke 1200 and kicked off the one before that. or when it broke 130 and kicked off the one before that. its always the same.
2
Literally remember bitcoin at 80k. Must’ve been a precognition
2
So boring. I'm sick of this 2% per day shit. When 10% per day like old times?
2
All the rest alt coins are behind of BTC, in 2021 when BTC was at $69k all ALT coins were ATH too, this time is not the same, example: DOT was at $50, ATOM was $40, FIL was at $180
1
We don't have the post halving rush of newbies... yet.
1
It’s just not that high enough yet
1
It's like when Bitcoin was at $20k in late 2020
1
69K was last cycle's peak, so maximum hype. The correct comparison right now would be Bitcoin breaking 20K in 2020.
1
This rally are going good
1
$HODL to 100K..Retail hasn’t even entered the chat yet
1
Just my opinion:..Back in 2019-2021, a lot was different. Yeah BTC was hanging out at 13k, but the research for stock to flow was less known, the FUD was strong and adoption was lower, but now the space is maturing. More people know what’s going on. The fact that the price is climbing is kind of expected now, but its also a reminder WE ARE EARLY.  Once the price doubles the party will start.
1
Stop price anchoring, just up!
1
Shhh, what’s BTC? All have been told!
1
This is "quiet bull run"
1
Im honestly just waiting for it to go down again so I can buy more
1
If the current trend continues we’ll be over $130k by the halving, which is completely insane, but that’s when they’ll be back.
1
But what does this tell us?

Feels underwhelming

Small investors in bitcoin has been flat for nearly 2 years now. With bitty at ATH and still no attention, once they start piling in (and they will) things are going to get CRAZY...Here's a chart:.https://twitter.com/RenMacLLC/status/1767547785279140071

We are just watching in awe, trying not to jinx it with big words.

That’s how it feels actually lol it blows my mind when I look at the chart and I’m like “oh. Damn. I remember when shit was hitting the fan at 16k like not that long ago” 😂😂
1
I guess it's because we all know that we're gonna see much higher prices soon. Still great to see new ATHs!

ALL TIME HIGH ..^^^^^\*unadjustedforinflationmaycauseirreversibledamagetoliverandkidneys

I mean, there's a difference from a run up from $10k to $69k where the previous ATH was $20k and a run up from $30k to $73k where the previous ATH was $69k. 700% the previous ATH vs 5% the previous ATH is a huge difference. It just feels like things are getting started. If it goes to $450k, you bet you'll see people partying.
1
Give me 100k or go home
1
$69k was the ATH from a former ATH of $20k. That would be comparing to this ATH being ~$250k...Not that I think that's a realistic target, but more buzz will likely happen as it hits $100k (just for the psychological effect of big round number).
1
Once it hits $100,000, might as well hit $200,000. ..Once it hits $1,000,000, might as well hit $2,000,000. ..Once it hits a billion, might as well hit 2 billion. ..And like several stocks hit $1 trillion mcap, might as well be BTC. Ever more people not selling and holding there economic energy in the form of BTC. ..This higher it goes, more people just eventually stop considering selling. Low to low in the bear market is up as the money supply expands.
1
It’s crazy, the usual ‘spike’ that we saw every other bitcoin bull rally I have seen to get to ATH hasn’t barely shown itself at all this time around, it has more been a ‘casual’ kind of gradual bit by bit rally to get to ATH this time around...I don’t think this is usual for Bitcoin price rallies as far as I have observed in my 9+ year BTC watching experience....I’m hoping when the spike does actually starts to hit this time around, I think it’s going into it’s going into whopper territory.
1
No retail money entering the market though… did you notice it’s still whisper quiet. Bag holders aren’t coming back w stimulus checks
1
At least admit you are Gambling.
1
I've been in this for a loooong time. I was there for the $1k bull run and crash. I was there for the $69k bull run and crash. My USD investment is so low into BTC that I am not that emotional about it. I'm happy if it spikes, but I am not eager to sell if it falls. I might start taking a few thousand USD out just to enjoy life a little though.

Anyone notice that Sundays have big moves?  Saylor said on CNBC that he does his buying after hours

Sooooo… .We are here to stay ?

See you at 100k, friends 🧡

This is like going camping on a mountain and we just keep going higher and higher but of course we have to rest, eat, sleep, celebrate and keep going.

It is just the beginning!

Next Party Stop is at 100k

Expecting a dip at 75k from all the shorts. I’ll brb buying that dip.
1
just chill. thrust me it's way easier than hyping every good or bad news.
1
Cant wait for the "do something" memes because it stays at 73k for too long. 
1
Also because last time the new all time high was 20k then it went through to 69k. .Let’s see now.
1
Everyone sold to pay bills cause it's fucking wild out here. So like me I'm bitter and silent, watching my imaginary portfolio of what I did have until life smacked me pretty hard

Unfortunately everything that goes up, must come down.  But LFG motherfuckers

Inflation

To be of the same value as in 21 because of inflation Bitcoin needs to hit 79k.
1
And i keep buying 🤷🤷
1
🤫🤫🤫..Don’t jinx it 😂
1
Do check again now 😁
1
100k is going to be *the event* for bitcoin for a long time..the day bitcoin crosses 100k it’s going to be all over the internet and on every news network and site
1
Awesome!
1
We were
1
Whatever is happening right now is a healthy correction which is good for the alts...Let’s be patient and start investing in parts before it’s too late!
1
It dropped to 68k
1
Lol because we know its going to go MUCH higher thats when we will celebrate
1
We're looking for something closer to $80k, after inflation adjustment
1
This aged well 😂
1
This aged well
1
This didn't age well lol
1
It could take 3-5 years to reach 100k and that’s okay with me.
1
This is awkward…
1
Yeah great time to buy. I put another 4500 bucks in.Got myself a p34. Yay!
1
This aged well! Lol
1
I have a feeling bitcoin might drop back down to the 50s
1
Few changes since then other than PTSD..- Pandemic work from home is over (less activity in social media -> less.Noise).- No stimulus checks showing up (less cash -> less FOMO).- Affected by inflation (higher cost of living, not enough savings -> less FOMO).- Changed social media landscape after Elon bought Twitter (Some party people who were active last cycle may have left the space -> less noise)
1
Let's go back to 73k but this time, learn from our mistakes and make a big deal about it.
1
Ehh I feel the hype is about the same.
1
We'd be celebrating every other day. Just enjoying the ride.
1
Still havent considered inflation. Technically we srent even at ath yet hhahaha
1
Yeah well, we're at 97k in the great white north!
1
Honestly it's not the ATH until around $77k. You never say housing prices are at an all time high without factoring inflation into the equation. With inflation we need to hit slightly more than $77k.

We haven’t hit an ATH. You have to adjust with inflation. Nominally ATH is different for any currency it’s being priced in and nominal ATH is practically irrelevant to anything

So, we made 6k in 3 years? Nothing to brag about.
-1
We party at The Dip now. Cheaper drinks, better food, etc, etc
247
We’re barely at the ATH. This is like when BTC hit 19k in 2020 after the previous ATH in 2017. The mania comes later.
58
At 100k
16
People didn't go crazy at 22k, 23k, 24k, 25k. Let's see how high it goes before we start sucking each other off.
45
Bull market just warming up.
10
I think it's weird right now because most of the movement is institutional, and retail fomo hasn't even really piled in yet. Which also means those institutions getting in at these averages will want to run it later. ..So I think the real retail party is yet to come post halving as it always has, and it's going to be a *WILD* rip
12
It's gonna come my guy this excited me that nobody noticed. The new boring number is 100k cad
7
The party only starts when we see 10x alts. Not making life changing euphoria inducing money with the small bitcoin gains
5
We aren't there yet. ..It will go up then dip and people will be nervous then it will go up again and surpass the high. (48k)..It will go up then dip and people will be nervous then it will go up again and surpass the high. <waiting for dip(73k)..It will go up then dip and people will be nervous then it will go up again and surpass the high...It will go up then dip and people will be optimistic then it will go up again and surpass the high...It will go up then dip and people will be optimistic then it will go up again and surpass the high...It will go up then dip and people will be confident then it will go up again and surpass the high...It will go up then dip and people will be happy then it will go up again and surpass the high...It will go up then dip and people will be happy then it will go up again and surpass the high...It will go up then dip and people will be happy then it will go up again and surpass the high...It will go up then dip and people will be euphoric then it will go up again and surpass the high...It will go up then dip and people will be euphoric then it will go up again and surpass the high...It will go up then dip and people will be euphoric then it will go up again and surpass the high...It will go up then dip and people will be euphoric then it won't surpass the high.
14
Too early! Wait until it goes to 1 mil 😉
3
The logic is flawed. If this was truly comparable then las time it would be a celebration after we beat the previous ath, so like 22k or something. 66 was the ultimate ath, like the tippity top. 73 is just a little above it and we have a ways to go before we hit the new tippity top of this cycle.

Holders are turning 30+, we tired bro.

Not paying attention, told someone about it a few months ago and she blew it off. Ran into her yesterday and told her it was at 73k her response was: "wait I thought you said it was at 40k!?" ...My response: "it was at 40k, it's now around 73k"

15
Ain't nothin to it, DCA made me do it!
14
Yep. People have to remember that the dip buyers for the 69k top in 2021 were buying at ~3k a year ago...That pattern won't repeat, likely, but if it did.....69k/3k = 23..23*16k = 368k...And at that point, the game theory is _fully_ active. Why on earth would it just chill between 250k and 1m? No shot. ..."Oh, this... actually might be the new money? Well... I'll just wait and buy the dip."..lmao ok

exactly.

Not selling at 200k either.

Lifeboats become more expensive the longer the ship has time to sink. At 200K, it's either float or drown for investors in traditional finance.

Yes we are in such a better place this bull run. We have the ETFs, the last bull shook out bad actors like FTX, and there’s the upcoming halving. This is the perfect storm.

Or bitcoin is dying?

I dunno it seemed like a friggin party all the way from 30-69k last time. Nothing but bongos, dancing cats and roller coaster gifs.
26
>people will be celebrating once it hits 120k and not a moment before. Thats when the real party starts...You don't think the party will start at $100k?  That's a nice round number.  I think it starts there.  That will really turn some heads.
12
I’m thinking 100k will be the opening hype threshold this time around. Good gain on previous ATH - and people like big round numbers.
16
this is the only reasonable take. comparing the current price to a real end price of a bubble ATH is not a fair comparison.
25
This; a wise man once said something like;    “we’re at the tippity top of the mountain, and we’re only half way up”.
7
Btc was at a low of 3.5k, not 8k
10
I see your logic, but no way. 100k will definitely ignite the party.
8
I feel like that run up got cut short.  Still don’t  know why it stalled where it did.  ..But I’d say it’s more accurate to talk about from ATH to new ATH rather than low point to new ATH.  It was about 3.5x from previous ATH of 20k to new ATH of 69k.  I’d say the party starts at $240k now.
1
HODL is for the long term. In the short term you need to have enough cash on hand to pay for emergencies. Shit happens. You either set yourself up to be reasonably prepared for it or you spend too much life worrying about the day that it definitely arrives.

Honesty that would be shocking for me.  For it to not even double after the halving would be weird.

sarcasm?

Then prepare to scoop

Lol did you only buy in the 10 minutes it was $69,000?
1
Will it ever dip again?

Bitcoin is dead. Again.

Yeah I agree. Last time was the same, something changed I checked all the subs I could feel the energy. Then I checked back a year later and it was mania. I don't think we have mania yet until HOOD stock doubles at least.

What!?..... suddenly the term "blow-off top" has a whole new [meaning](https://youtu.be/alw9xTCUQFQ?si=36BLLl7X9njezTqw). 🤣

I’ll suck you off right now. .1 btc and my mouth is all yours

If FTX managed to stay liquid they would just have continued their fraud, and have another magnitude of damage by now. ..Just think about other so-called 'exchanges' that might be doing this. ..NYKNYC.

I know it’s a completely different asset but that’s what exactly people were saying in was about GME lol

As long as people keep depositing fiat in my bank account I’ll be scooping up sats with it.

People expecting next bear to still have a 80% dip… I guess nobody truly knows but…I doubt it 😆
12
Will you be upset when it goes to 10 mill and now the house you bought for one bitcoin could only be sold for 0.1?
8
Im gonna pay my rent for 4 years and HODL the rest for 4 years.
23
Why not sell the top and wait next cycle to buy back in at a lower price? As someone who’s held for the past 4 years, I would’ve benefited greatly had I sold at the peak and bought back in a few years later
1
I'm not selling ever. My entire portfolio is going to my children or grandchildren as inheritance...Something about planting a tree you know you'll never sit in the shade or reap the fruit of.

lol go back to your troll sub dweeb
1
Lol, didn't expect such toxicity to a bit of irony xD
1
Yeah I think $50k is more accurate. I have a buy order set on GBTC for $40. Who knows if it will actually hit that low but one thing I do know we are due for a healthy correction before another big push up.
1
Why not
0
Ahh yes thank you
39
Because that was an actual bull run, this isn’t yet, or rather it started like 2 weeks ago.
2
The ATH from the prior cycle was 20K, so yeah 30K and up would be a party since all the old bag holders were in the green and just counting the profits during the climb up...For relative comparison, 50% over the previous cycle ATH would put as at 103K.
1
It’s also not a fair comparison without accounting for inflation. $69k in November 2021 is $77k in today’s dollars...edit: [source](https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=69000&year1=202111&year2=202402)

Yes, will it ever be below 70k again? No one knows. But it will most likely not be a forever bull-run.

[effacé]
16
Yes. It is to volatile not to. How far will be the question. Then again how far up it’ll go before the dip is another..I predict it will dip after the split and sit here until then with some but not much change. ..The dip will be the test. Many people are expecting it to skyrocket afterwards which won’t happen because we have already gotten that boost the last 2 months.

Yes, it always does!

Looks like its going to deep about 30~40% than go back up until end of the year. Then dip again

Yeah maybe he thinks he almost pulled it off..I think the FTX shakedown cleaned up a lot of books..For now, I think we're okay, 2 years into the imminent bull run? Who knows. I don't think Blackrock would take kindly to that however.
3
Right? I kind of want to put together a graphic of all the "cycles" where like Amazon drops 80% a few times and Facebook was down 50% on its IPO. So many examples where stuff went up and down and trained the traders to make mistakes then blasted off never to return.

What lower price? My average is like 11k.
1
Cause nobody knows where's the top.
1
My kids inherited 30k from their grandfather, which they wont receive until they are 25. 15 years away. im putting it in btc for them now.
2
By the time Bitcoin matures they won't have enough to convince someone to leave the protocol in exchange for whatever they're pitching to BTC holders. A lot of the assets and collateral that "investors" today hold as a store of value, may not have any utility to a Bitcoin holder 30 years from now.
2
Because if it even drops below 20k there will be immense buying pressure
6
There's 19.6 mil btc in existence, there never will be more than 21 mil, and close to half of all btc is lost forever...At a price of 5k/btc, that would make all btc in circulation (roughly) worth 50 bil USD. There's small countries with GDPs higher than that, plenty of corporations with more, and even a couple dozen sole individuals that have more...The last time btc was at 5k, it was no where near as globally well known as it is today. At 5k everyone would be buying, but the reason it will never reach 5k is because everyone will still be buying at 6k, 7k, 10k, 15k etc.

both of you, be my friends. I like you both.

I hope so. I got some cash poised and ready to jump in if so!

The split? Do you mean the halving?  If so why would that make it dip instead of rip?
2
I mean it will dip but a series again is will it ever dip below 70k again?..If it goes to 100 and 120k then the new floor might just be over 70k
2
I can't see it going below 59k during a flash crash
1
What do you think will be the floor of the next bear marekt?..&#x200B;..Seems like everyone thinks this bull market will hit at least 120.
1
None of this has happened before.  ETFS, halving, around 70k for a while all at the same time.
2
Theres always a floor

I’ll suck and blow until he has to pry me off his wank. I don’t give a shit how many mouths he could get. He can’t get this one without .1..I know my worth!

If BTC hits 420690 I’ll suck off this whole sub. Happily.

Sold %10 of my portfolio to reinvest in a month or two

It definitely will
4
It will dip, nobody can know if it will dip from 70k to 50k or from 100k to 70k, but dip it will.
5
Yes the halting, didn’t realize I said split...It would because people have already bought into it and are waiting for the halting expecting it to skyrocket. When it doesn’t there will be many selling off. These are the ones looking for a quick buck. So yes when it happens it may go up but it won’t skyrocket and it may go down...The reason it won’t skyrocket is the less people are able to buy the less likely they will buy it. It works the same way in stocks as well.
1
Annnnnd....it at 69K
5
It’s possible but chance is really small to hit 100k + and for the bearmarket I think it will be around 30k-35k

Not specif news obviously but Bull run and News

Sir, this is a Wendy's
15
Yay! It's gonna happen one day!

Would you tell me the last 3?

Almost any item will always go up in price since the dollar goes down...Actually, nevermind, there are probably a lot of shitcoins and stocks that will not always go up.
5
You do need money to buy, though. Where is that money going to come from?
1
No. Obviously not.
1
There aren't.
2
Ahh yes thank you
16
Plan was to buy $200 a day until I have 1 coin...Decided to buy the first 5 days on this dip

I’ll just take a fry and a frosty to go please

Hodl on tight

Sweet baby Jesus

I don’t need any money to not sell, though

Not selling doesn't make the price go up though

Let's be real, dude... you are going to check back a lot more often than that.

You bought today? *The balls on this guy*
636
buy low? Never. Always buy on upswings.
269
I think it'll work out fine, just don't sell if it dips briefly and your amount turns negative for a bit. Just tie yourself to the mast as needed.
140
Just YOLO’d 20k
67
Thank you, gonna take Profits now.

FOMO is hitting HARD this year. Like a fucking obsidian sledgehammer to the face
84
Buy high sell low. This is the way!
74
Wow why did you wait for it to get this high. Unfortunately I’m reading this like a top signal.
87
1 hour later, RIP
29
He's finally bought! Dump it boys
47
Buying at ATH, hell yeah brother
68
1 year? Buddy, try 3 fucking years
82
The key to growing this is really to ignore the daily price action. There was a guy in here who lost his keys for years which prevented him from selling. His coins were worth 150k. I'm sure now that he had access to the coins he probably sold out.
22
Retail fomo starting?
20
So when bitty was $15k you were like, "nah, too cheap for me!"
53
Jesus Christ this sort of thing is depressing. Your life savings? FFS..a) it was sat at 20k for 6 months. If it wasn't a good buy for you then, it certainly isn't now. .and.b) this is your life savings and (I mean no disrespect) they are not large. This is why you will almost certainly panic in one or more inevitable major dips, and lose it all or at least most of it....Honestly, this is the poster child of what not to do...
279
Holy shit this dude just caused a massive dip.
29
I miss when .01BTC was $300. Soon it'll be $1000 which is wild
13
Classic, you made a correction happen. Now tell your family to buy so we can see 50k again.
12
Buy high and sell low
13
I hate seeing these posts when we approach ATH. Makes it feel like we're at the top and retail is about to get murdered.
56
Damn, bloodbath incoming.
11
I love when people go ham during highs 🤷‍♂️
11
You glorious son of a bitch.
11
Why did you wait until now lol
10
If these are your life savings you will need the luck.
29
are there any metrics that measures the frequency of these kinds of posts or the number of hotline stickies etc? i think reddit data can serve as a good signal indicator
10
You picked quite a volatile day to drop your life savings into Bitcoin!
9
Why do people always dump their life savings when it’s near the top? Lmao
8
Buy high sell low
7
There it is, time to sell folks

I bet this dude is like 20 years old. He'll be fine.

Imagine doing this, then logging in 2 hours later to see the ZERO BALANCE glitch on Coinbase.
13
All in at the top probably should of DCA good luck
29
You’re supposed to buy low sell high not buy high sell low… you belong here with us lol. (But with Bitcoin just buy and never sell so it doesn’t matter when you buy. Late is better than never)
6
Did you at least put aside 6 months living expenses in a high interest savings account before you did this?
20
Sorry bois its my signal to start DCAing out
22
You are retarted.
10
🤦‍♂️
5
FOMO POSTS FOMO POSTS
6
Dump it all in at 12 month highs.   What could go wrong.
5
People when btc is at $20k : this is shit is going to zero..People when it's 60k: BUY BUY BUY !!!!
6
i feel like it’ll get back to $16k just like it has in the past.
5
I hope you wont need this in near future, and that you can keep your emotions in check if things go south in the short term. Looks like impulsive buying increasing in seriousness. I hope thats not the case
3
don’t sell if there’s a dip always stay confident
3
Welcome to the FOMO stage.
4
Ah buddy… you should’ve done this 2 years ago
4
“Now that it’s run up for half a year, and the prices are at all time highs, I feel safe to invest my entire savings”..Human psychology is not well paired with investing. Wow...You understand this is like hearing all clothing at your favorite store has doubled and going to buy some of those clothes because they’re finally expensive.
5
“Hey just DCA at 20k” “NOOOO LIFE SIVINGS IN IF IT GOES DOWN FOR ALITTLE I GET MAD!”
5
JESUS MAN SELL OUT NOW  ...You dont fucking yolo your life savings at peak pricing lmaoooo jeeeesus
5
Life savings? Check back one year from now? Hilarious...Your gonna be checking this shit every 5 minutes. Then after the coming crash you're gonna cash out and lose half your money if not more. NGMI.
3
I salute you, you fkn legend. This is still early. ..These days BTC is making the headlines all over the world. Feb 1 2024 we were at $42k, now $61k. The train is moving fast, get out of the fkn way or join fellow bitcoiners. Most ppl still have no idea what's going on. We hodl all the way to Pluto!
5
Putting your life savings in when we are nearly at an all time high is ballsy
4
The time to jump in like this was last year, expect some pain soon
5
Buy low sell high ❌ Buy high sell low✔️
5
So fomo. Just wait a day or week to buy at 40k....However inlobe people doing this. But relax!
3
The definition of buying high
3
Time to sell. Top indicator in
3
Stupid move.
3
Time to sell when everyone starts getting in... house of cards situation?
3
Buy high, one of us.
3
I little slow to the punch, but do not panic sell.
3
This is my indicator any time bitcoin goes up that I either need to sell or hold off with buying. The level of stupidity is incredible.
3
Thanks for the donation brave soldier.
3
You poor soul, the halving event will make or break so many weak hands
3
This is so foolish my dude. Gonna have to have diamond hands for what's coming.

GAMBO
3
Second phase peak can't wait till the third peak I'm betting it'll be 100k by the end of the year 😅 I'll be DCA my ass off until then
3
Buys at the top of market expects a profit
3
Guy no offense but this is a really bad idea, like to the point where I hope you're trolling...You are falling for FOMO and buying on the swell instead of buying the dip a few months ago...If bitcoin continues to rise to a staggering 120k you will have only doubled your money.
3
I bought $30 worth today if that counts >!and $30 a day for the last 2 years!<
3
You'll get a 2-4x imo.
3
STRAIGHT FOMO
3
BTC at 16k: 🙈.  .BTC at 64k: 🤗
3
You re wrong, you should buy on a bear market not bull 😂 but good luck
3
Why so many people buy near ATH ?
3
ok, I take this as a signal we reached the top, thank you
3
Dude goes all in at near all time high prices. This must his first bitcoin cycle.
3
You bought during all time high and expecting to check in a year??? what logic is this
3
Going to 150k this year congrats!

Guh
2
61000!

Here comes the average fomo joe, good for you, but don't expect an easy ride. Sht goes up and down fast around here :D
2
Are we in the FOMO phase again? That was quick.
2
Fuck me your dumb
2
People get it at the price they deserve,I think we got 1 more small pullback then supply crunch 101 kicks in and it’s every man for himself ..not your keys
2
Be ready for a pullback to 44, 38 or even 33k! So.. don't sell at 50% draw down :)
2
bro the RSI is like 90
2
The FOMO is strong with this one. Waits until 60K to FOMO life savings into bitcoin instead of buying under 50K.
2
FOMO intensified
2
lol. I think I’ll wait until it goes higher. Maybe the highest point in 3 years before I dump in my life savings.
2
Buy high sell low
2
Let the FOMO surge through you!
2
So much for DCAing
2
The time to yeet your life savings was last year when we were in the teens and 20s. You’d have doubled or tripled it already if you had.
2
A classic fomo example right here
2
Just don't sell until next week :P
2
The Fomo Buy
2
Jesús christ where the fuck were you? Lol
2
I seriously don't understand why people are buying right now, but okay
2
Lol. This is not the time to do that!
2
So we’re at this stage in the cycle
2
Ah yes, buy high sell low
2
Gooood. Good. Now go take out the biggest loan that you can't afford and you're welcome.
2
nigga u coulda bought in september october november december and been up at least 50 percent but instead you aped the top.
2
Life savings invested at ATH. What could go wrong?
2
It really hurts to see people do this. So godamn painful….
2
Why tf are you buying now? Most here were accumulating 20-30K range. ..Thanks for letting me dump on you today 🙏
2
If if drops this guy guaranteed paper hands that shit
2
I sold everything now. These posts are massive flags to sell and come back when the FOMO hype is gone
2
Did you buy today's top?
2
The FOMO is real! 🤯
2
Why buy? Trade 100x
2
This belongs on wallstreet bets: one of us, one of us, one of us 🦍
2
Buy high. Buy low too. Never sell.

Fucking Legend! Buying at the top!
2
A solid example of FOMO.

Already made a good 10%💪🏼💪🏼

Time to take Big Biiiiiggg DUMP like in 2020 march 😩🥱🤪😛💩💩💩🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
2
bro bought the top
2
Dude... you have picked the riskiest time to go yolo my friend. The trend is far too early in the cycle, graphs parabolic, and the vast majority of BTC holders are in the profit zone, we waiting to drop our bags.... I mean some one needs to hold the candle and push it further but damn. Let the ETFs and the liquidating shorts do the heavy lifting. You had years to get in for this bull run, and ull have years to get into the next one, hopefully.
2
You better have an emergency fund in fiat lmao
2
So u didnt wanna buy when it was all red for more than a year and decided to buy when it got to ATH ? I mean if u really hodle u might get x2 hope u have the stomach for it
2
Should have done that 6 months ago.
2
Not best time to buy bro
2
Why is it people have to do this precisely when it’s volatile they have 3 years to buy but they need to risk it all last minute for the thrill of quick gains, hope these are not futures or options he bought
2
Nothing like buying at the peak👌🏻
2
At the high?
2
Buy high sell low.
2
So you waited until 5k away from ATH to risk your entire life savings, rather than throwing it in when it was extremely oversold… gotcha
2
Buying a month ago - +130%..Buying 5 days ago - +20%..#OP: hold my beer
2
Why didn't you do that last month?...Here come the YOLO posts
2
You did the right move which given that we are in a bull market is to buy a lump sum . The timeframe is incorrect, should be at least 4 years . If it crashes remember : it’s just temporary bc the society we live in cannot survive without printing money which make btc rise in the end , and more importantly when things go south think : “there is always another halving” . At that point you understand that time is your advantage and that’s how you beat the market and win . GL
2
Your a degenerate
2
Imagine not buying when BTC was 25k and fomo'ing at the top again
2
Pretty weird time to be buying outside of a typical dca or something - imo.
2
Ah the classic buy high sell low strategy
2
you really putting in life savings at damn near ATH 😭you can’t make this up
2
sell
2
So my mom just called me about BTC. Mind you, i dont talk to her about crypto. This is a sign guys.
2
Ahhh yess thank you for pumping my bags
2
few advice, ..first you should never invest all saving, invest only what you can afford to lose...second investing in crypto while is going up can be extremely dangerous.
2
why in the fuck would you buy NOW?
2
this is so dumb
2
BUY THE HYPE SELL THE DIP
2
Read my lips: check back in exactly 19 months...Put a reminder in your calendar. You are welcome!

Getting in at the all time high, classic.
2
Ok people with 5 figure life savings are putting everything they have in....that's the sell signal.
2
I’m not sure this is a diversified portfolio. But it was spread over 3 days.
2
why didn’t u buy months ago?  never chase green candles
2
Having been through this cycle twice… why
2
Lol.. I blew my account too. It sucks. Stay strong dude.
2
Feb 27 Feb 28? Apparently buy high sell low is the move
2
Well, that's the top, this has jinxed it
2
But high sell low!
2
You should have bought in November 2022 🧐
2
If you did this now why couldn’t you do it 6 months ago
2
Why do people always YOLO in at the top, couple months ago it was half if not 1/3 of the price but noone wanted to buy then
2
Yeah well if btc jumps into price discovery, it’s anyones guess high high it will go.
2
automatic books fanatical literate flag wrong deserted engine familiar zesty.. *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*
2
You bought at an ATH..
2
Why did you wait so long to buy?
2
just remember you could have bought a whole btc when it hit the lowest ... people will never learn . BUY high SELL low ... this is the way
2
Oh no.
2
You could buy at 15 k, but buying at 60 k is always better 😂
2
God you people are incapable of planning even just 1 month out. It’s all just knee jerk buys. ..This shit was hovering at 30k for almost a year, it doubles and now you dump in your life savings?
2
Bought at the peak. Should have bought months ago. You'd have tripled your investment already
2
Hold the investment.  Bitcoin is supposed to split near the end of next month.  After the last split, the price went up 600%.  So let it ride and take a look a few months
2
Bro you should had waiting until correction happen but it's okay its gonna hit 100k sooner than expected
2
You need to be mentally prepared for BTC going down at least into the 40’s again. ..But you’ll be ok in the long run
2
So far so good buddy! Congrats!
2
I would have waited for bear market probably around 30k bottom I know I'm going all in at that price
5
Why not when it was 42k after etf. Good luck, though.
3
Good luck for this ride
2
Life savings of what?  Inflationary nation-state coin?..Buy more Bitcoin, it's your only hope at this stage...
2
Using your life savings to buy at the peak? Ooof this guy is in for a tough time
2
Check every 4 months, the next cycle is supposed to be in 2025 meaning it’ll most likely go 80% down as tradition dictates but the next halving will be around 15 april so there is 2 bull signs to check for. Or just let this one go and catch the next one but you’ll go through 3 years in the red
2
Your life savings is $17k?..And you're going to gamble with it on something that's basically at its ATH?..I don't know if that's more stupid than reckless
2
bro is buying at 64k lmao
2
It should hit 180k then come back to 60k or even 48k. I predicted a return to 9k to12k from the previous 60k high. One of these halvings should take it to the Moon. Must be the 2032 halving. ...2028 should only be a 600k high
2
Why one year? The whole point of it is to protect your money and time over a long time period not one year.
1
Why didn’t you do this months ago?
1
I put a small portion of my paychecks into BTC over the last year. Now my crypto portfolio is about your life savings. Went from $3k to around $10k.  I started buying on the way down. You have to be ready for the inevitable winter to come. But many analysts online will tell you that it likely won’t go below $50k again, maybe ever. Truly crazy times. Let’s see where it goes 😎
1
Bro bought to top fomo at its finest
1
Probably feeling pretty good about the purchases so far lol
1
Congrats, you already made 27% gains.
1
You are brave. I have $150k that im so tempted to just throw at crypto. Yet here i am still buy a $100 here $100 there.
1
Remind me! 1 year
1
Respectfully, ATH is not the time to yolo. I’m bullish, but hopefully you actually have an emergency fund still.
1
Bitcoin will hit 100k this year. We haven’t even hit all time highs yet. Secondly there only a million coins left. Third if you take inflation from bitcoins 65k top in 2021 that would be 75k today. The amount of bitcoin coming out will be cut into 50% which will cause an even bigger supply shock. I think 100k is the minimum….
1
Bro this was supposed to be done 2 years ago at 16k, this is where the buttcoin users stem from stuff just like this, will we go higher? With time.. but when it inevitably pulls way back he gonna be maddd
1
Not trynna be that guy but if this was actually your entire life savings it should have went into mutual funds, not BTC
1
Bro we are nearing all time highs and now you wanna all in?? Please be realistic, I know this is a btc sub and I’ll prob get downvoted to hell but you could be down horrendous on this play. If you absolutely want to get in now at least avg in over a few months.
1
I thought we had atleast 6 more months before posts like this. Oh well let the mania begin…
1
This is mental retardation
1
Why people only finally decide to buy in when it gets to these prices is beyond me. Everyone calling it a scam at 20k but dumping in their life savings at 60k smh
1
Never put all your eggs in one basket! First day of class!
1
Yall not even buying full coins when it’s at 60k?..Lmfao what the fuck🤣..Bro. Think.
0
Yikes.  Def fake
0
Your life savings was only just over $17k?
0
I been HOLD'g for 6 years.... Finally a BIG payday is coming. I'm already UP more than 3X on my 45K in crypto, most of it is BTC, so while one year may seem like a long time now, its not really. BTW, BTC isnt going anywhere... it'll still be around after we are not :)
0
Jesus Christ. I remember when this would have cost you like $30 😂
-1
RIP.  Btc will be way down in one year
-1
bc1quwwpw6fmts4r5904awyxyzx85jse7umq5usax0..Help me and my family own some bitcoin karma will pay you back double !!

Fomo’d
1
Dump it
1
It’s only a loss if you sell, best advice I’ve ever gotten
1
Why
1
lol wow
1
You guys still have fiat?
1
we are SO back
1
why do ppl still buy at ATHs and sell at ATLs?
1
Welcome to the club, you've bought at a low price considering where this is going to go.   .I bought my first coins in 2014, and yes at the time I thought that was a lot of money.
1
Man, that you had to do this winter. Still, i guess better late than never (we not late at all). Congrats anyways
1
I'm jealous. I've been dca'ing for the last 3 years to have less than you. You are going to be just fine.
1
Check back in 5 years
1
That’s the way! Buy high sell low 😎
1
Lol great now we might have reached the peak or local peak
1
wow, life savings at an almost ATH?.....
1
This is the sign that we're going to dip very soon. I'll wait for then lol.
1
Mate, why did you wait until we breached 50-60 to go all in? FOMO got you by the balls.
1
FOMO time!
1
It’s pretty close to the ATH…not sure going all-in now is the smartest but fuck it. Just hope you’re in for the long haul. It took us two years to get back to this point lol
1
I hope you see this: Believe it or not, you are thinking of the best case scenario waayyyy more than the worst. As things stand BTC might blow past ATH soon. But what after? "Will be back one year from now”?? If I were you I’d get a quick exit plan to get back at least my life savings asap.
1
I mean congrats? I'm just dumbfounded why people buy now vs the past 3 fucking years
1
Why do people buy when the market is going up? Bitcoin crashes for over a year and you could have bought then. Why are you buying now when it’s on the rise????
1
Diversify.
1
Finally 60k so i can buy!!!!!!!!! mode activated..dumb money is coming in.. time to take profits????
1
So it begins. It is that time of the cycle. FOMO with life savings.
1
Bought the top
1
Lol fomo in at near all time high.
1
FOMO FEBRUARY
1
Jeeze. At least wait for a pull back
1
If this is not proof we are at the top I don’t know what is haha..There were soooooo many of these posts back in 2021, and all of those guys sold in summer of 2022 😂😂😂
1
Wrong timing to buy
1
DCA in when Greed and fear is in fear/extreme fear. DCA out when extreme greed hits..It's not that difficult
1
Buy High, Sell Low 🫡🫡🫡
1
This is the sign to cash out.
1
Fomo is a helluva drug
1
1 yeahr ago you would have gotten a whole coin for that amount of $
1
Get a hardware wallet
1
My god people are dumb.
1
Buy high, sell low; the wsb way
1
Bro… we need people like you for exit liquidity. Idk why people buy now instead of anytime the past ~14 months but hey, I love it!
1
It's at least gonna ride until halving. 100% passes 100k
1
Buy high.  Love it!
1
Time to sell is very soon!
1
Damn FOMO hitting hard.  Glad I was DCA'ING and buying all the way down and heavy at 15.5k.
1
Depending on his/her age $17,000 can be made up and a lesson learned.
1
FOMO
1
entered around 40k, we caught this run up. selling into ATHs and will recapture an entry on pullback...this is nuts though
1
You should bought for 10k first... Now you bought the top
1
You will not last a month
1
Dude, you had 3 years and you chose Feb 2024...
1
As someone who supports Bitcoin I do not support risky plays like this, if you have a family I implore you to take some winnings from here and summer
1
FOMO buying. Classic 👌
1
Just sold my Mom, wife and kids,.Wish me luck 🍀
1
Good luck ! But you don't really need luck - as long as you have a nice long time frame, you'll be fine
1
You are genuinely a mad man. For real, just don't check the price for like a year if you can
1
hahahahahah we are definitely back
1
So you're the one pumping the price
1
What an idiot 😂
1
Buy the DIP
1
This guy FOMOs
1
Buying high, i like it
1
Intense
1
wall street bets is that way ->
1
Why do people just buy when its at the top? Just to suffer.
1
The FOMO is real. Better now than never.
1
It’s hitting 63,000 now
1
Worst time to purchase tbh.
1
Make some profit and pull that ish out. You timed it all wrong. Btc was low and confidence was down, that is the time to buy. Definitely not now.
1
I’m camping out till this wave settles
1
bro you waited for the worst time lol
1
You chose near ATH to buy in? ..Fomo much?
1
Fucking Legend.
1
HE'S ALREADY IN PROFIT!
1
Just wanted you to now that this is an emotional decision, wich are no bueno.
1
Yikes lmao
1
Just don't panic sell EVER when price drops. You probably will if you don't take the time to understand Bitcoin.
1
\*five years from now
1
My dad just bought his first crypto today. After 13 years of me telling him about it.
1
Buy high, sell low is so real.
1
Today? Not a few weeks back on few weeks in the future? Better than never I guess
1
Plan to hold for 10 years.
1
Not cool.  Do not take this level of risk if that is your life savings
1
A life savings before the halving event? Were so fucking back bros
1
Where the hell were you at? Its at 60k now 😹 but still early than those who'll buy at ath
1
Now?
1
Take profits while you can!
1
What site is this?
1
Just hold into 2025 and you’ll be golden piney boy
1
Why did you not do this when it was like $20k?
1
Where were you 6 months ago?
1
Buy High, Sell High?
1
This wouldve been sexier if you did it when we were at 17k last year or even in October lol
1
Gonna sell now because i know based on this guys luck and trade, ita about to plummet
1
Why would you buy in while it's pumping? Asinine
1
I wish they allowed gifs in the comments…
1
LETS GET IT youll be happy when this cross 200 k us
1
F
1
We’re going down
1
This is my sign to sell 😂
1
DO NOT SELL EVEN IF IT CRASHES 50%. I did the same on the day of the ETF launch. went down from $46k (my avg cost) to $38.5k at one point. everyone was telling me to sell and how we would go down to the low 30’s or lower but I HODL’d. best decision ever.
1
Buy high sell low
1
Guys we found the fomo buyer
1
leapoffaith.gif
1
Gotta chase them candles
1
Buy high sell low
1
The FOMO on this poor bastard.
1
Just cashed out 40k in profits. Thanks for the free money
1
Why didn't you buy in 2022 when it was $25k?
1
The problem when you buy with money you dont need right away, what els to do than hodl when its moons..I have no idea what to do with 2.5 BTC
1
Textbook case of FOMO.
1
A lot of people hating on OP for buying bitcoin…
1
For all FOMOing, it’s too late.
1
I like how you waited for it to quadruple from its low point before you decided to buy. 75% of returns pissed away.
1
Fomo has been put on the menu boys
1
OP if this is your “life savings” you are either very young or fiscally irresponsible since this is insignificant.  I’m guessing the latter since you didn’t make the bet 6 months ago and instead are FOMOing in. I get it. I did it too with what money I couldn’t afford to lose back when BTC was $1,100. It was going to 10k by next year for sure. Instead it crashed and stayed at 400-600 for 4 long years. I needed that money and I didn’t have it. Instead of selling I took out loans to pay for my new roof. ..Now OP, if you can’t handle this crashing to $30,000 and staying there for four years get out now. Sell for a tiny profit and laugh it off as a weird thing you did in the moment. ..Orrr you can be “dumb” but work your ass off to be frugal for the next couple years and re-invest back into your savings. Forget about the Bitcoin and only look at the price when you hear on the radio about new ATHs.
1
Ahhh, nice! Lets see in a month when its done correcting 😂 why are people so stupid to do this shit when its peaking like this. Makes no fucking sense
1
What in the world have you done? And where were you 6 months ago?? Best of luck
1
Lol! This is just FOMOing in! Why didn't you buy BTC at 20k 30k and 40k??
1
I'm selling right now!
1
Buy high sell low mindset right here LOL
1
Exit liquidity? At this time of year? At this time of day? Located entirely in your portfolio??
1
🔝signal.
1
Good lad.
1
And the sell signals start coming in again…
1
here comes the pullback guys. 
1
Can I give a guess how much it will be worth 1 year from today? By following bitcoin power of law and my x amount experience of TA:        0.29731099 BTC will be worth $38,650 +- 7%. 
1
This escalated quickly! I feel like I'm watching you play poker as you double down from $2.5k to $5k to $10k.   ...Check back in 5 years.
1
What was the reason for doing this now rather than a couple of months back?
1
LMAO, dude sees close to ATH and goes all in...Time to do that was 16-20k
1
Fomo is back on the menu boys
1
Fomo
1
Welcome to btc. Remember to buy something because you believe in it not because of fomo. If you believe in bitcoin then who cares what price you purchased at.
1
Ready for the MF ride! Tick tick tick that’s us going up the rollercoaster.
1
Aaaaaaand it’s gone
1
Should of invested in a dip it’s peaked now
1
oh boy
1
One year? Yeah… this is how Buttcoin subscribers are made
1
Why buy at a near ATH...eish, good luck.
1
Why did you wait until now to buy?
1
Domp eet
1
thanks, selling
1
The top is in
1
Nice start. From now on DCA what you can afford👍
1
This guys ganna last like 2 weeks and sell at 50K.
1
Buy high, sell low!
1
Luck has nothing to do with it.
1
dont worry. you now have the best life saving option on the planet ⛵️⛵️
1
You will have no regerts
1
Buy high sell low, my guy
1
Don't sell if dip
1
One year?  .Maxi or troll...  .   .Everyone else checks the ticker every few min.
1
This belongs to r/wallstreetbets
1
Damn you had no savings
1
Good luck mate, don't panic sell.
1
Good luck….
1
Don't forget. Buy high sell low
1
Of course you did, what could possibly go wrong? Bitcoin just did 300% in a little more than one year, it just went straight up with no corrections, perfect entry point for a lump sum.
1
As the poker dealer always says: Good luck to you.
1
You really just FOMO’d your life savings when Bitcoin is about to hit an all time high…. I’ll be sure to give you an extra loaf of bread when I volunteer at the food bank
1
Local top confirmed.
1
Results aside, this is extremely stupid and dangerous...Take heed and do not do this people
1
Better late than never
1
Is it too late to start getting involved in this or should I wait for a pullback?
1
buy high sell low keep it up
1
Life savings at close to ATH. /jesus
1
What?
1
Gargantuan gonad gamble, good luck.
1
Once we hit $70k it will fall to $51k to shake out the weak hands
1
You chose great timing, is there any reason you didn't buy at 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 , 21, 22 , 23K ?
1
Bitcoin CEO saw this post and lowered the price to teach you a lesson
1
When Nana and conspiracy nuts start asking about investing in crypto; double dip incoming.
1
Top is in boys
1
Congrats on buying the top bro, someone has to
1
Enjoy the rollercoaster ride
1
Nooo not yet! The bull was just getting started
1
I am probably silly but I will wait for the halving before I do my life savings and foreclose on my house lol
1
It’s always nice to see the bitcoiners preparing to get rekt. ..What not to do, a bitcoin subreddit.
1
My platform  offer 600 percent profits on every capital invested . And you’re funds are safe ,secured and insured by state farm Insurance, you can click the link below to read about us , our Chairman Joel Greenblatt and Robert Goldstein ..https://gothamcapitalinvestment.com/index.php
1
Perfect FOMO ;)
1
The Bank wins 😅
1
So at the top? Come on now. Just don't post suicide posts when it dips hard in a few weeks.
1
You'll check back every 20 mins max.
1
You waited until NOW to do this?! Bull run is 100% back
1
Bitcoin will keep going up until the halving. And even after. It needs to go higher than the last high before it falls
1
About to do the same with 4x leverage tho, there’s no way it dips 25% before the halving
1
Why does all these people always decide to buy at the top? When it's low it's dead and when it's high suddenly they need to invest their life savings
1
No wonder price keeps pumping 😂
1
How do I do that remind me 1 year comment thing because this is one I wouldn’t want to miss lol
1
oof
1
Oh man…on a pump day.
1
[https://youtu.be/61Q6wWu5ziY?si=CtZPCnUfNSq-Nrpo](https://youtu.be/61Q6wWu5ziY?si=CtZPCnUfNSq-Nrpo)..-He bought?..>He went all in...-DUMP ET
1
Signal for a local top. We are in for a correction before ATH.
1
You will be heavily depressed this year.# 🔮
1
Bruh this kind of money would had be 1 btc not long before
1
yeah nothing like buying high selling low
1
This is a sell signal.
1
What happened to coinbase?!
1
Should I say: 'This is the way!' ? :)
1
This guy was probably waiting for BTC to dip to 10k so he can buy in.
1
Buy high, sell low. This is the way.
1
yikes
1
The best way to make money is to buy high sell low
1
Buy high sell low
1
Should have done this a week ago lol
1
TY OP for letting me know to sell 😂
1
We’re so so back.
1
Buy high sell low!
1
And coinbase goes down
1
Haha HELL YEAH!..Before I joined the Army, I dropped every dollar I had into Bitcoin…..…Now I’m just building back up my cash stash and letting my Bitcoin do it’s thang 😎
1
Dude you probably made the mistake of your life ..Why would you buy at its all time high ?
1
This guy knows how to buy high and sell low!!!!
1
Should have done this a year ago….
1
2030 it's a better goal.
1
FOMO is in full swing again.
1
R.I.P..How much would you like to earn and how much are you prepared to loose? ..I see like 20-40% possible price increase - short term ..And..40 - 60% possible correction - short term ..Would you survive?
1
alright i think its time to sell my crypto lol.
1
Of course it would crash after you bought.
1
Following
1
I'd say, "please don't do this unless you know when to sell" but you've done it already. Well just learn about charts so you'll get out at the right time
1
Buying at ATH levels when you could’ve bought at 17k, 27k, 34k, 40k… retail never ceases to amaze me…
1
Buy the Peak, sell the Valley. This is the Way.
1
you're in for a wild year
1
Jesus Christ... I hope for your sake this has much more to go before eventually coming back down.
1
Thanks for buying my sells!
1
Thank you for the top signal. I’m dca’ing out
1
You FOMO’d in.  Good luck
1
Holy shit your the reason it pumped so much today
1
That was incredibly stupid. DCA at least.
1
And just like that, the sell off has begun
1
We're so back baby
1
Shaking out the long positions...I almost got wrecked myself.
1
Shaking out the long positions...I almost got wrecked myself.

Fomo 🤦🏻‍♂️
1
Retail will be so fucked holy shit
1
This is the way. However I would diversify and buy some promising alts. The best bitty will get you is a 2x maybe 3x

Buy high sell low this guys got the right idea!
1
Christ, I hope this is a joke, buying when it's flying up and not looking at it until a year later is near a surefire way of losing money. But hey it's your call..
1
Thanks for the dip
1
KANGS BABY
1
You might be in trouble my guy.
1
Oh no...
1
And now the correction Probably will come :( has run to hard. But eventually it will skyrocket
1
Buy at ATH.. great
1
Buy high sell low is the way
1
I think he sold already
1
I think he sold already
1
Hold or hodl my friend.
1
Never sell

You were sleeping from 2 years?
1
You were sleeping from 2 years?
1
Haha......2017er here who came in near height of bull run.......When it crashes, don't sell, don't kill yourself. And instead start dcaing....In 7 years, you'll be happy. Albeit I didn't put all my life savings in....Given your hard fomo you'll store all this "safely" on meta mask
1
Hell yeah lets ride brother
1
Fear and greed - 82 - extreme greed. This post checks out. Can’t wait for the pullback thanks!

1
You are retarted.
1
And it's down 8%
1
There’s money and then this type of money
1
Why didn’t you do this months ago?
1
Sure we hope BTC continues to rise but putting all your eggs into one basket is just foolish. BTC should only be a small part (5-10%)  of an overall balanced portfolio.
1
[effacé]
1
Hold on tight... Wishing you the best of luck!
1
Hold on tight... Wishing you the best of luck!
1
I would check the fear and greed index before dumping life savings in.
1
Im thinking to go ang live in the forest for a year...
1
All in at the almost ATH is crazy 💀
1
Why are yall buying at the top?!?!?
1
I was wondering who’s buying while the rockets are on full trust upwards, knowing that it will almost certainly have a drawback very soon (before it hopefully continues up)..Now I know! 😊..You’ll win in the long run anyway!
1
This is so sad. Your life savings are by no means disposable funds. Putting everything in one basket is really irresponsible. Security comes from diversification. A broad portfolio balanced with short and long term funds is what you need to be able to sort through the ups and down of our economy. Wish the best of luck, but (not knowing anything else from you) this is no different than betting all for red in the roulette.
1
you had more than a year to buy but nope, it had to be near ATHs.
1
Continue to DCA and HODL and no luck will be needed.
1
Good to check next year!..Whatever you do, do not sell lower than you bought (HOLD through the halving)!
1
Why didnt you do this 3 months ago? 💀💀💀
1
Casino Bitcoin is up and running again
1
Should have done this at 17k
1
Ah, FOMO. What a beautifully heady, mind-*uck you are, you sultry, shameless temptress! ..I get it. I thought about something similar and just as frenzied but am more afraid of being divorced overnight than fear of missing out on BTC gains, so I will stay in my safe, DCA lane for now, alas...  I will live vicariously through you!
1
Oh no he bought in too late
1
Why not do this 2 months ago? Did you just come into those money now?
1
I would dump everything and just make more fiat
1

You're late to the party mate!
1
Why would you post the exact amount of your bitcoin holdings?  You're inviting scammers to do their nefarious deeds.  Dumb.

What do you do if it drops 50%?

You sir, just FOMOed hard, meaning we're probably at the peak right now and you'll soon be pretty sad (until it goes back up and if you hodl).
1
Dude don’t, that’s just gambling and everyone knows how gambling often ends going broke.
1
I can't believe how much fomo it happens lol every 3o4 years and these post are the first to sell and get rekt
1
Ha.  Life savings and only look at once a year.  Sounds suspect.
1
Good move, I wish you luck and I wish you had bought that when it was at 15K because you would be at 300%+ profits. Remember they just keep printing dollars making them worth less and they keep spending them tho they owe 34 trillion that means your savings in btc will keep going up over a long time period my man. Dca ftw.
1
The last fall in price in btc ,  one person that did that cried so much and sold it too low.  Never to touch Bitcoin again.  Must of us are dca and investing 1% of our wealth.  Best thing to do.
1
Why the hell didn’t you do that when Bitcoin was 20k-30k brother… smh
1
you will be fine! Good luck and don't get scared if we have a little pull back here
1
Buying high has historically worked out in the past. Good luck bro/gal
1
Why do they always wait to do this at this point. Comically ridiculous 
1
U could change your life and your children life.  We are still super early.
1
Lmao
1
Of all the days you could’ve bought. You bought today? 😂😂. But welcome back brother we are def so back
1
Why people jumping in when there is extreme greed? 😂 for real, I mean good for you but that’s really not a clever time to invest
1
God i should have put my money in and deleted the app
1
Lol
1
Ahahahaha wtaf
1
good move, we just getting started
1
Uff... Dont get it. Worst case youve to wait till the next bullrun (if there is one). DCA would have been better
1
you seriously bought right now? beginning of the month it was 40k…. 🤷‍♂️
1
You fucked up hahahah its tooo late man
1
 That’s guy that caused flash-crash, get him!
1
I mean if he had his life savings a month ago 😳. Why all in today? Sorry bro but it’s like the peeps that don’t buy at 17 cus too high and go all in when it’s around the ath. Def should have dca
1
Remind me! One year
1
You’ll b fine… just sell your initial investment once it hits 100. & let it ride
1
He’s my liquidity exit 🤣. Thanks bro
1
JUST HODL!!!
1
Goodluck 😊
1
mania is widespread, but how widespread?
1
Good luck brother
1
Rip
1
you put your life savings on btc at almost all time high when the price hasnt even pull back??? lol i wish you the best of luck my friend but this was kinda reckless tbh
1
Ok serious question though - as someone who’s admittedly ignorant in the cryptosphere, when it was under all the actual shit in the gutter after getting in not at ATH, but high enough that my losses were sharp, I wonder… how do you KNOW that Bitcoin (or any other crypto) will not just either go up completely in flames, or end up so low value that it might as well have gone up in flames for anyone who bought around sep/oct/nov 2021? I want to have this strong conviction, but I don’t understand where it comes from.
1
We’re definitely in a bull market guys, the normie retail apes are here
1
Fuck it, im doing the same. ..Degen gamblers 🤝
1
FOMO’ed
1
Lmao FOMO buys love it
1
Oh damnnnnnn now we’re cooking!!! See you in a year!!
1
Your gonna buy it when it literally shot up past expectations?? Lmao what could go wrong? I have no idea I never traded before 🙄
1
While this will still turn out profitable for you. I dont understand people that dont buy when there was a crash. I throw in more money when it crashes. And buy less when people are euphoric. Worked out pretty good for me. Catching knives hasnt hurt me sofar.
1
Balls deeep
1
Strong conviction 💪🏼.This is what I’m here for   .Now just be patient and you’ll thank yourself down the road.
1
did that 5 y ago still not cashout waiting and not cheching portfolio everyday
1
Peak fomo😂😂😂
1
If only people knew what a Bitcoin actually is and how it is made, people would have stayed a billion miles away from it.
1
Life savings at all time highs, time horizon one year...What could possibly go wrong?
1
This aged rather poorly
1
Ah, fuck. Time to sell already?!
1
Damn…. You had all this time to buy it under 15k n you started to buy now? If it was me I’d buy alt coins first then bitcoin
1
Damn all these posts are bumming me out. Usually when you see people yoloing their savings that means were near the top.
1
You buy BTC on highest price since long time? Bro...
1
Well this aged well… oh it was just this morning… oh okay… still..
1
Thanks for being exit liquidity
1
You bought in at the high??  Did someone not advise you that the high is the time to sell??
1
Oh ooo! FOMO is starting. Time to book profits.
1
Good luck
1
So we’re at this stage in the cycle
1
I went balls in too my man. About price as today. I’m only just in the green again. Do what you need to do.

Why do people do this at all time highs lol
1
Get ready for pain
1
Ahh classic buy high sell low
1
You shoulda done this when Bitcoin was 16,000
1
is he REKT?
1
Why are people buying when the market is up? If they had invested six months ago, they might have already seen a 4x..
1
in 5 years you wish you put in more
1
Lets Go!!!!! Good Luck!!
1

In 6 months we're going to see the "took out a second mortgage to ape into BTC."
1
This guy fomo'd
1
HELL YEAH. This is bout to age pretty well
1
I respect you as you’re either in or out, I like someone who doesn’t do half measures and you will win...Only tip i would give you is when BTC has appreciated enough for you to pull out your initial investment I would urge you to do so that way your BTC that are left are for free.
1
Why do they always got to do it when we are at or near previous highs?
1
Bro
1
Why buy now when it's up 45% in three weeks. Where were you all last year?
1
This subreddit just continues to show me how dumb people are. LMAOOO. Get ready to get rekt, i hope you will still “HODL”. ..How does such a small percentage of the community know how and why the market moves. Its too obvious and everyone falling for it. Wait for the whales to wreck most of yall. Best of luck
1
Bro just dca ur experiencing retard lvls of fomo first off why the fuck would u invest at nearly the highest price ever recorded dawg secondly ur basically gambling at this point.
1
It is the time….
1
I've done that years ago and never looked back.  I'm net positive.
1
Should have jumped in at 18 homie
1
LOL, already?? Bearish LFG
1
That’s a smart play all day everyday imo. Even if btc tanked by €90% tomorrow? In the long run? That was the smart play to make. Sure you could have done it weeks or months ago but “everyone gets ₿tc at the price they deserve”. Congratulations and welcome to the ₿tc club bro. You have an exciting few months ahead of you. Gonna be fun looking back on this post. ✌🏽🇮🇪
1
smart man
1
I only put about between 5-20 bucks each week since I work and go to school. I ain’t putting too much unless it tanks but still it’s a risk.
1
what a fat headed move.
1
Hahahahahhhaah here we go again!
1
My goodness!..$BTC will probably go up from here, reach a new ATH, and probably reach $100k. You should have done this a year ago. You're going to cry when the inevitable 20 to 30% drop happens.
1
Can't lose when you buy at the top! Good strategy!
1
Looks like you did those purchase amounts backwards to say "see you in a year".... ..Shoulda, woulda, coulda.... Good luck...and see you in a year! :D
1
Fomoed in at 60k... Shoulda bought 1 year ago brother.
1
Lol so he did it nkw until he lose some money and sell? Wtf is wrong with ppl
1
Why do people love buying tops so much?
1
I'm waiting to switch to USDT before it crashes and rebuy when is low
1
My buddies co-worker just emptied his 401k to buy. I feel like we should of passed ATH by now.
1
This person putting their life savings into Bitcoin is a data point that on the Fear <> Greed spectrum, that we are at "extreme Greed".
1
So buy high and sell low ? Why not dca ?
