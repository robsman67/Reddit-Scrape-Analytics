That is a very informative thread. I’m new to this as well but it does make sense. Sequencers have way too much power and fragmented liquidity has been an issue ever since DeFi became a thing.
1
In short, this:...>Sequencing is driven by the base L1 - where L1 proposers replace L2 sequencers and can permissionlessly include a rollup block in a L1 block.....>This enhances decentralization/liveness as more proposers are onboarded, reducing risk of chain outages/censorship.

Those are my thoughts as well but it is always great to her a different perspective.

OK, that sounds very interesting but I will need to do more reading on this. IMO anything that helps decentralize sequencers is a good thing but I’m no expert on the downsides.

You seem to be using high leverage but nevertheless just simplify it by calculating in tokens.....If you are longing LTC which is 60 right now with $10 and 6x margin you will profit $1 for ever $1 LTC moves upward. Of course, you will be loosing the same amount at the same rate when it goes down.....In general I would advise that you use low leverage until you figure everything out.

100% in BTC is no good. You should diversify. Do something like 99.5% BTC, 0.5% random crapto and you're good.
23
ALL altcoins eventually bleed back to BTC
12
Bro... If you're looking to "diversify" from BTC, you just don't get it
11
100% in btc and DCA
4
I'm doing 50% BTC and 50% sol atm. Eth is also a safe bet, but I don't like the transaction fees, so I don't really touch it. BTC to hold, rest to trade when there's gain. And eventually buying more BTC from the gain, plus little treats for myself here and there.
3
I tend to accumulate nerd/tech tokens where the Dev team is very active and Avant-garde thinking (L2,RWA,AI tokens mostly)...Also, I lately hold China related projects/coins thinking on a full "crypto unban" in the next months.

My portfolio is mostly btc. Then i have quite a bit of brett, avax and pepe. Then small amounts of aero, render, ondo and a few other small caps as a bit of a fun gamble
2
BTC and ETH

I think your strategy is decent. 50% in Btc, and then pick a handful of high market cap alt coins to dabble with.
2
$BTC - bitcoin, $KAS - kaspa, and $BRETT on base

Meme coins will always go up during bull runs
2
I go roughly 50% btc 40% eth 8% sol 2% matic & a couple other coins

MATIC

Btc and Ether are the safest...50%-50% or 70%-30%

imo SOL will have better % gains than BTC this Bull. It's the narrative of this Bull run. I hold BTC as well & I went with SOL &  some smaller MC SOL ALTS tokens as well. (JUP,JITO & NOS) Also, in JLP which is a liquidity provider for perpetual traders. I take my gains from ALTS & put them into BTC.
1
Cash it out before it goes to zero.

I just really don't understand BTC's draw. It's antiquated crypto tech, slow & expensive to trade & is costing our electric grid a crap ton to mine. It's actually straining on the grid too. ..It is the Kleenex of the crypto world, I get it, but a crypto's value should lie in its tech / utility, & BTC just doesn't have that. ..It's soooo weird. I can understand also why someone'new' to the crypto space would want to buy it. It's most famous, but I can't really wrap my mind around someone who understands crypto & is buying it in large percentages of their portfolio. ..Please tell me why?

BTC should be your first in line then you can add up few alts which holds solid fundamentals. I've got some in my bags like SOL, PICA, BNB and also DOT. You can't go wrong with these also.

How many of you have excess money in this sub lol?

Pretty much the entire alt market is mostly flat level in relation to Bitcoin and is traveling with Bitcoin. Personally as a payment system Bitcoin is very bad at it's primary function it's super slow and has exorbitant trading fees. Personally I'm holding XRP because it's a very practical payment system to actually use for daily transactions. That and multiple big businesses as well as bullion dealers and banks are taking XRP seriously and are accepting it as payment for transactions. There's nothing that Bitcoin or any other crypto can do which XRP can't do better, faster and cheaper. More than that it's better, faster and cheaper than conventional banking.
1
You're making a mistake keep it in Bitcoin...The fact that you just have Bitcoin rather than only alts and no Bitcoin is pretty rare because most people enter this space thinking "ah Bitcoin is too expensive I'll go buy something cheaper" despite the fact that they have no comprehension of supply etc. So anyways they go into all alts and no bitcoin the bear market comes and their alts are all down 80-90% and so is Bitcoin. When the next bull market comes Bitcoin bounces back up but the alts don't always bounce back up so now you've got a bunch of bags they're holding. ..At this point you realise you should've just bought some damn Bitcoin. ..There you go, saved yourself about 4 years there...Story by: my coworker.

Crypto is always a cycle swing trade. It’s not an investment…yet. (Maybe 20 yrs BTC will have a high enough market cap and the tech will be adopted broadly by mainstream finance and governments for the volatility to reduce enough. But this era it is not.) Have a multi year bull cycle plan first that forces you to take profit. If you don’t take profit in crypto you are the profit for others, period. Next you need to learn Elliott wave and understand where you are in the cycle. Right now, 9.6.24 we have already pumped over 250% and are finishing a pullback in a cycle wave 4. This means MOST OF THE BULL RUN HAS ALREADY HAPPENED. We have a wave 5 left to end the bull run. Which could reach 80-180k BTC if it over extends. BTC is crypto. It alllll follows BTC in the cycle. Smaller caps like Solana and even smaller like AI coins act like BTC with leverage. More exaggerated swings but ALWAYS following BTC’s large time frame direction in cycles on weekly monthly chart. The key right now is to learn and WAIT and be ready in USDT. We are finishing what has highest probabilities to be a wave 4 pullback. The signal you want will be for entry on a 5 wave move to the upside. THEN you will expect a 3 wave pullback. THIS pullback is the entry point that confirms higher probabilities of takeoff. (Otherwise we could just be going back to 30k and below which is in the cards)Learn Elliott Wave. Don’t hodle or diamond hands. Take profits and recognize most profitable in crypto wait painfully like a motherfucker for probability to lead the way. If you just want to DCA you will be looking for blindly buying regularly. Follow hot narratives Defi/AI etc. and roll the dice. Most spread over many many teeny caps with the right narrative and good hype. Small caps are largely hype based so cool website, catchy hot words, social engagement. But fucking sell that shit like the plague and NEVER GET MARRIED TO COINS!!

1.5k is not “diversify your portofolio” type of money.. the best thing to do would be to invest in yourself and work slowly on a higher payed job and start dca-ing from there. Crypto does not have much more to go untill it reaches a top.. it’s been almost 2 years since bitcoin bottomed up on the ftx news. There is a huge chance that in 3-4 years.. we will see these prices again si starting wish 1.5k to just have 1.5k might be frustrating..

I was "diversifying" back in 2013/14 (BTC 80% and 20% LTC, Doge, ETH ...). Only Bitcoin matters.
3
Give me an example of an alt thats not 1-2 years old, which is making new ATH's in its BTC value trough the cycles ? You wont find one. All alts eventually bleed back to btc.  .BNB is perhaps the closest thing to a non perma - bleeder if one exists.  .Even ETH couldnt make new ATH's in BTC value after its pump in 2017, ever since then its making lower highs and admittedly higher lows. ..remember, we are talking about alt/BTC pairs, not alt/USD pairs.  .The goal is to outperform BTC if you're deciding what to hold rather than holding btc.

Exactly - Crypto is a high risk investment, and today's generation need access to investment options that appreciate faster than property. Fiat has lost so much value that property is unaffordable. Tax crypto at 50%+ and you're destroying any hope of zoomers or millenials having any social security.

Bitcoin is an antiquity, as crypto regulations start to provide more clarity. Accredited and international investors will start to move away from the antiquities and onto cryptos that can keep up with markets. ..Eg. Hedera Hashgraph, Hbar who is queued up to have trillions in tokenizated RWA. ..Fixed fees and absolute finaility means lower cost and lower risk, and it already has govt and institutional backing. This means it will keep to the good side of regulations going forward as well.

Title: Top 10 Cryptocurrencies to look out for in 2025
1
Missing Akash, but yeah I mostly agree too 🤣
1
It's a list, many lower MC coins will out perform the average from that list.  I'm not criticising any of the coins, but while BTC is the least risk and many have low risk in term of losses, they're also going to have low growth in all likelihood.   You'd expect DOT, for example, to have a much higher return from todays prices versus BTC ETH. ..We also have very little knowledge of changes/improvements from numerous coins and their effect on performance and price.
1
Akash looks quite promising and i think it's one of the promising DePIN projects that would do quite well in this run and as a result i am hoping to add more to my portfolio with hopes of being able to restake it on Parasail Network.

1
Before you consider it, remember that selling your account could come with serious risks, like security issues or violating terms of service. You could also risk losing access to your account or facing legal trouble. It’s usually best to keep your accounts secure and avoid any transactions that might compromise your personal information.
1
If you’re holding only alt coins ya that’s prolly fair.

Well I'll tell you I'm from a 3rd world country, I don't think I'll make it out lots of people have come here insulting me without realizing what that $100 could do for me! Idk I still might do it I asked this cause maybe I need a little more money
1
I don't think the account contents are meant to go with the account. The point is to get use of the account, not to rob the till. You'd clearly want to withdraw your priceless shitcoins before handing over a password.
1
I totally understand your situation and how difficult it must be to weigh these options. Your safety and security are really important, though, so I’d recommend being cautious with selling your account. The risks involved, like security issues and potential violations of terms of service, might outweigh the immediate benefits.

>Is the price of BTC being manipulated to liquidate Futures positions on purpose ?..Let me guess, you are a relatively new in crypto space and you bought near all time high ?
2
BTC often dips in September. Would expect further red the first couple of weeks. FED decreasing rates around 17-18 Sept might kick start Risk-On assets just in time for UPtober
2
 I don't know....... Bitcoin is at the top of it's cycle on the long term chart which usually means down. BUT We also recently had a halving as well, which pretty well always means we're going to a new all time high. It's going to be very interesting after the next 2 halvings. It won't be profitable to mine bitcoins anymore unless the price and transaction fees become astronomical. At some point it won't be cost effective to use bitcoins as a store of value. Nobody wants to hold a coin that costs many thousands of dollars to make a single transaction. I believe we may see the end of bitcoin dominance and the rise of a new currency.
2
Whether BTC is being manipulated or not, I can't say for certain. But you should know that historically, BTC tends to be in the red in the month of September.
2
Look into moon charts , sounds hocus pocus but it actually uncanny how the pice follows the moon

In my opinion nobody will know even if they think they do

Although it might have something to do with trading😳😳😳😳
2
It has its ups and downs. But since it's foundation, Bitcoin specifically has only appreciated in value and will continue too further down the line. I don't think Bitcoin is the end all of crypto nor something the average person should even worry about considering 50 to 60k is not money people can just afford to put down. Granted they could invest in memecoins that derive their token value from Bitcoin. But for that matter you could go with any other memecoin backed by say Ethereum or Tether.
2
Because it has already reached its all time high for this cycle and now the only way is down.

But not your queation your comment was i think tge price changes at the end of the mibth i need more data to prove it you wernt asking learn you hoping to shortcut the informatiion best way to learn is see it go through the steps to find it youraelf draw fulk conclusions then cone here and be hey i noticed this went back looked over the last 7 years and saw thia whats the reason in yiur opinion then you learn more.

The only honest answer. It's crypto, it doesn't do anything and therefore can't be compared to stocks of companies that actually provide solutions for problems. Crypto is just a casino, and 4 out of 5 years the house wins.

Thanks for your contribution. What if I want to trade in bitcoin? I am more concerned about the seemingly timed “drops” at or around the end of every month.

You can buy a fraction of a Bitcoin. You do not need to buy an entire Bitcoin. ..Memecoins do not derive their value from Bitcoin. ..USDT is a stablecoin and it is used on a number of different blockchains. No memecoin is ‘backed by’ Tether.
1
Alright 👍🏽
1
But there is no house
3
Nonsense. Crypto is as good even better than stocks in returns if you understand the patterns of how it works. When it’s bullish and bearish when to buy and sell. Market also crashed it’s because of real live issues.
2
But what are we going to do now that the fiat experiment that's run for the last 50yrs is failing .. we can't rely on the USD PERTRO dollar anymore. They'll be inflating their way outta the debt they're in. So the world looks set to eat an economic shit sandwich with some big unknowns like now that USD isn't "as good as gold" as they touted at the inception of America's fiat adoption what are we going to do? Back to a gold standard... Me thinks not. And I always thought there was shit loads of gold sue to secrecy of state reserves etc but even if they match what there is in holdings it's actually surprisingly small. You should check out the volume of all the gold in the world and Sus out what percentage of it is held where etc....Anyway the point is Blockchain is a perfect currency... Specifically Bitcoin. The rest are shit unless they closely model The OG Bitcoin. All hail the future of currency... Until we have automated android servants that self repair and replicate on command. Hurray for everything. And I'm going to get me as much Bitcoin as I can so as to be able to afford one of them handy robots... With tits... Aghem... More aesthetically pleasing etc...
2
ends of months can also tie into expiring options prices, bitcoin specific option market isn’t that big but tech stocks and broader equities markets will have impact. Same with week end and quarter end to varying degrees...beginning of the month usually is about traders and funds getting positioned for the next go-round..(again just general statements)
3
Or you could look at more months yourself to corroborate what you are saying with more data
1
You dont need other people to notice something that is visible on a chart you're looking at.  .You're looking at BTC in a vacuum instead of looking at the general economy state. BTC performance is very tied to DXY performance. Usually the price of risk assets tanks before QE arrives. Assets which are higher on the "risk scale" are the more sensitive when it comes to reacting to positive or negative market sentiment. We are likely to see prices go lower before EOY, and 2025 will likely be better for risk assets after QE arrives.
5
The people with more money then you are the house :)

>Crypto is as good even better than stocks in returns if you understand the patterns..Exactly, and that pattern usually is 4 bear 1 bull. You actually.understand that, from what I hear, the average person doesn't, otherwise those patterns would change. Again, crypto doesn't do anything, public companies do.
2
Or you could move on without commenting 🚮
3
Cheers for the further explanation. I had a broader theory on the drop during the end of the month. The post is not concerned about general drop. It is concerned about drop at the end of the month.
1
Or you could just yeah man you riggt i should look at at least the last 5 and a half of 11 years. Damn chief its not like its wasy hey google machine btc price on 1/31/17 2/28/17, you getting mad cause you wont put the work in .Maybe yiur right maybe not but at least pull your own data .
2
Btc is correlated to a 3x leveraged nasdaq etf. Its highly speculative with high beta...Its a risk on asset you dont want to own during risk off periods when the dollar rises and does well when the dollar falls...Tech has risen huge past 15 years. Therefore btc has risen huge.

Start with $12, when you have lost them you can try with $24 and your improved experience...Keep going until you lose the $120...This may sound as a joke but it's not. In your head you should make sure you understand that you WILL lose that money before even starting.
3
I try to day trade, although if one of my trades end up not working I just leave it and keep going with a clear mindset
1
This, paper trading is good and will help with fundamentals and getting the hang of it, but when starting with a small account balance, it puts skin in the game without destroying your life. (Unless if $120 is gonna do that haha)...It'll give you a glimpse of your mentality around wins and losses and how you react to them. If you grow the balance and do well, congrats. If you loose it all, then you know what not to do next time...All experience's will help you grow mentality and technically for trading...Good luck and I hope you win!

Not too sure as I didn't / don't use one but a quick Google search brings up the following:.App:.CryptoSim - Market simulator.. - looks decent and allows you to start off with 10k in paper money...Website: .Bitsgap - looks alright but you have to pay after 7 days...Gainium - free, use of trading bots and seems to connect to Trading view...Obvs - DYOR before signing up and look at reviews of each, but that was a 30sec Google search for options.

Title: Is DePIN a big thing in Crypto?
15
I agree that DePIN has the potential to be a big thing in crypto. By tokenizing physical infrastructure, it's bridging the gap between the digital and physical worlds. But it's not without its challenges. Regulatory uncertainty, scalability issues, and the need for interoperability between different DePIN projects are some of the hurdles that need to be addressed...There is this Energy Web Foundation, A nonprofit organization working to decarbonize the energy sector using blockchain technology. Also, Rivalz Network is a decent project focused on AI data provenance within the DePIN space. They're working to ensure reliable data for AI applications, which is crucial for responsible AI development.
6
I reckon so check out Onino and what they are doing...[Onino.io](http://www.onino.io)..People saying it's just a cash grab because it's going after an industry that doesn't need moving over to blockchain don't have a clue that governments are already implementing blockchain because it's the next step in the evolution of the internet.
4
[supprimé]
13
It makes a lot of sense on the surface but we still need to wait and see how it plays out. I see a lot of promise in it but that doesn't mean the idea will work.
3
It not only is. It will be the best performing narrative of the cycle. Because unlike the NFT or AI scam plays, it's not just a buzzword that any token can ride the cotails of...It directly contributes to decentralization, privacy (storage solutions) and the foundations that enables a blockchain based Internet.
6
Can't deny that. I've also seen some awesome projects in that space. Natix is one. Big one I'll say...But besides DePIN, AI is also trending. AIs like SightAI might end up being integrated with a lot of gaming and defi projects. I also got a chance to run Rivalz AI nodes and earn incentives. It's one I'm super bullish about.
2
Definitely, DePIN promotes wider adoption with its use cases. I was listening to an event on Twitter, DePIN Decade and there were many interesting projects with real-world use cases. DePIN could lead a new wave of incomers like NFTs did a few years ago.
2
I think DePIN is a big deal! It's one of the most practical use cases for blockchain, especially as it brings real-world infrastructure on-chain. Helium and DIMO are great examples of how decentralized networks can incentivize physical infrastructure development...Another interesting project in this space is Rivalz Network. They’re focused on building core data solutions for a future dominated by AI Agents and on-chain AI applications. They’ve got an upcoming node sale on September 10th, and you can get early access with a Silverpass through their Discord. It's cool to see how DePIN projects are evolving!
2
Another cashgrab with the fake good idea to put something that doesn't need a blockchain on a blockchain. Looks like 2017 is coming back with the exact same act.
4
How are DePIN different from RWA tokens?
1
It isn’t yet but I do believe it will be. I did an article on my site about it recently: [What is DePIN?](https://airdropguy.com/whatisdepin)
1
What companies like IoTex.io are doing is truly amazing. Depin for everyone 🔥
1
I say yes but that's just my opinion
1
Depin is for sure one of the trending narrative along side AI which has made me put real focus on upcoming Depin and AI projects. My Depin narrative project is Rivalz network which they just concluded their test net and had a lot of participants. Also my target on AI is Sight AI which they are preparing to launch soon as they deal with the security and privacy in blockchain with the implemetation of FHE. ..Looking forward to others too which I will be adding to the list soon.
1
Maybe, I see DePIN gaining traction though
1
Yes, it's a needed step into decentralizing access to the internet like GPUs and servers in general. Although, IMO decentralized AI will be the largest sector in terms of value in the next 2 years behind deFi - for the same reasons defi is important, deAI will be as well when AI becomes a normal part of life. Depin will continue it by catering to it. ..The issue is deAI has a lot of vapor and marketing gimmicks that pretend they're decentralized when they aren't, like telegram bots that pretend they're decentralized, or models with tokens that call themselves decentralized because you use a token to use the model.

0
Real world asset tokens are exactly what they sound like, tokenized version of real world assets or protocols that provide that service, such as Paxgold which represents the monetary value of gold in usd/oz on the blockchain...Depin is an entirely different thing.  You can think of it as blockchain infrastructure protocols that help to build the foundation of the wider blockchain/crypto ecosystem, and help it operate in fundamentally useful way that mirror technology and finance outside of crypto (indexing protocols, cloud storage, cloud compute and rendering, oracles).  So, we're talking projects such as Chainlink, Akash Net, Arweave, Filecoin, The Graph, etc.
4
DePIN focuses more on decentralized physical infrastructure, like connecting devices and networks, whereas rwa like Vesta, are about bringing real world assets on chain.

Title: show me what are the useful strategies u use ? 
2
buy and hold bitcoin. The end.
7
buy where people previously bought..sell where people previously sold
5
DCA, whatever you are comfortable with every month. I buy BTC and ETH.
2
check out my post history, very simple and effective strategy
1
I primarily use it to add to my bag.. in a down trend market ( like recent) I will buy the 8 percent and greater dips, when it goes into profits I scalp the profits and place it on market orders to buy back again at a lower average ( dips).  You end up selling less at the up price and end up with more buying at the dip price and lowering your average at the same time. It only works above the 8 percent margin, anything less you are just paying transaction fees and not really gaining, on RH platform anyways…. In the uptrend market you are only taking profits and maintaining your principal investment, what I haven’t figured out yet is when it really starts to move up how long do I wait to scalp with the profits compounding…..
1
Buy low sell high that’s all you need
1
Mine is simple yet effective (for me): HODL.
1
If you're looking for a real response, no one with an edge will share their strategies. It's up to you and only you for you to find that answer. Anyone who responds with a strategy is just a larper, that's the reality...DCA into assets you believe have upside, simple as that. Really, buy BTC and ETH since you're new because most people become victims of the memecoin communities which mainly cycle in new  buyers constantly with unit bias for liquidity.
1
DCA - dollar cost averaging...It means you buy BTC with a fixed amount of $ every week or month or whatever...Only buy BTC and never sell
1
This is the easiest and most profitable method in my experience.
2
but how do i know that this is the lowest price it could reach ? nd it's gonna reflect upward ? myb it will get lower ! u know what i mean
1
complete advice and answer .. thnk you so much 🤍
1
Price goes in waves,  u can confirm that by looking at any price chart. U need to answer urself are u at the top of the wave or bottom or the trend part. Then take trade accordingly to what position u r in. With experience and doing it 1000 times u will become better at reading the wave. Profit.
1
Don't concern yourself on price if you want to buy low caps. It's the combination of market cap, liquidity, and inflation. Don't be a victim of unit bias (buying tokens with prices of 0.0000000001 so you can have millions of tokens), upside does not change based on price.

Binance??

Nexo, they generally have lower fees and fewer withdrawal issues compared to other platforms.

I've only ever used binance and never had any issues
1
Is it straight forward like fund from bank account, purchase crypto, and turn around to send to external wallet without any limits or holds? Seeing so many issues with so many platforms is getting so frustrated.
2
Yup, it's user-friendly (big W), you can easily fund your account from your bank, they even have SEPA instant which is personally my fave because it's well... instant. You can send to external wallets and there are some limits but they are like 500k a day lol. I'm using Nexo since 2021, no issues at least for now, but their support is cool and fast if you ever stumble upon one.
1
Is it available for US residents since in the support terms it mentions the following:  "The Nexo Services are unavailable to citizens or residents of certain jurisdictions, including where restrictions may apply, such as Bulgaria, Estonia, the USA, and Canada."  Does that mean it's a no go for me being in the US.
1
Didn't know you're in the US, sorry bro. I don't remember exactly what the drama with the US was, but it was somehow related to the gov being an ass about crypto. The other platform I use is CDC. The eggs and the basket reason. You can try them out but I suggest reaching out to their support first and asking if you are going to meet any withdrawal problems in your case.

Title: Polymarket sees Trump ahead while predictit says it's Harris

It's a different audience - the polls disagree with each other because they're just samples - and polymarket is effectively a poll of mostly men (all tech and crypto is) with financial means (so mostly over 25), good tech skills (able to use metamask and crypto) etc - so their views are reflected in the odds. They're trying to make money but everyone has biases whether they're aware of them or not
10
Idk, if they're betting money on him then I think it's more than hope.
2
It's 50/50 at the moment....https://www.realclearpolling.com/betting-odds/2024/president

Obvs big media will be behind Harris. If anything, PM is reflecting what real people are leaning towards

Polymarket has been irrationally Trump since betting started. It was consistently a 5-10 point spread to all other markets. Trump was still 60-40 when it was getting into toss-up territory- I made a bunch of money on that spread.

Regulation depends on your citizenship/residency, but usually no tax on loans...Crypto loans are definitely useful, I used decentralized (e.g. aave) and centralized (basically any major exchange) options...Be aware that rates will fluctuate and keep LTV at 50-70% at most to avoid liquidation.
6
Nexo
4
aave, compound, and spark (dai) are the 3 onchain ones that are most reputable. CMP and Spark especially.
3
no tax in my country, anyway so far
1
This would depend on the laws of your country but usually crypto loans are the best choice, yes.
1
Crypto to crypto transactions are still taxable in the US. Let's hope you don't live there.
1
Because you are spending the money on personal expenses, I would not recommend borrowing against it. It would probably be cheaper to sell pay the tax and then buy back...Nexo will lend you money interest is around 18%.And yes, it is possible for the gains to clear a lot of the debt...I borrowed against mine, but it was for business purposes, so the interest is a deductible expense ..There are no repayment requirements, so long as you stay within the terms, remember unpaid interest compounds ..My process was to use profits from business to buy more crypto as the prices were rising ..The end result would be that I borrowed 25k and am able to repay that loan with just 8k of repayments...As I borrowed against btc when btc was under 20k..You need to be careful and fully understand the terms and conditions.

I see no reason not to pay the tax and enjoy the money, if you already have enough? Although, for now, maybe the best way is passive income, to let the money work for you and live off the interest... I'm doing it on Binance on several projects, and I've also put in AI Nodes from Ocean Protocol and Rivalz Network recently, that's a new modern way of getting passive interest in a decentralized way, which I think you are looking for...
0
Fluctuating rates are better than paying 27,5% taxes where I'm from lol .How do you pay back typically? In stable coins or Fiat? Theoretically, if you take out a loan after the market has bottomed and it starts going up again and you still have some crypto on the side, could you cover the interest you have to pay by step wise selling of your side crypto? That sounds like a best case scenario to me. You make use of the money without having to tax it and cover the interest by benefiting from market appreciation. Sounds too good to be true, so whats the catch (besides the risk of liquidation)? 😄
2
It looks like they'll lend USDC but not USD?
1
What happens when I get liquidated on an onchain platform? Can I top up to avoid liquidation or am I screwed if prices drop?
1
What country?
1
Are they actually? I'm from Europe, here its only taxable once you convert back to FIAT
1
Sounds good, but the interest is paid in the lent currency, right? So if I lend or stake ETH f.e., i get payed in ETH I assume. Meaning, to make use of the money, I have to convert back to FIAT and eventually I have to pay taxes anyway, or am I missing something?
1
You pay back in the currency of the loan...You can keep the loan afloat indefinitely paying % from some outside sources. But % can go from 5% to say 40% APY and back easily. Usually it's around 10% I'd say.
1
to my knowledge yes, also don't borrow more than 50%
1
This was the impression I had about lending Eth or BTC
1
Of course, you can change your interest to what you want and pay. And it is my wish that it be adopted as soon as possible, so that we can pay freely in crypto tokens everywhere.

The issue is; it seems obvious. Everyone's a genius in a Bull Market. I have traded 25 years and when it comes to Bots; there are still several issues  - including market conditions. Many claim to have built bots, if they worked as well as the claims - they would be going to JP Morgan to loan $100m based on the proof of results. Instead, they try and shill them to retail traders looking to get rich quick. If you are only looking to make traders to one side, simply buy after a pullback (don't use a stop loss \*\*Which is advice I would say - NEVER EVER trade without a stop) and let it ride for a year. So not much need to program anything for that scenario was the point. ..Always use a stop - I was just making a point.

1. Collect historical data for as many coins as you want..2. Plot data with logarithmic regression.3. Fit data to fitted function.4. Have bot buy when current price of coin is below fitted function. Have bot sell when current price of coin is above fitted function

Bitcoin is the most widely adopted and used cryptocurrency, and many people and institutions rely on it. Switching from Bitcoin to a new platform is not easy, even if the QAN Platform promises enhanced security. It requires a lot of trust and credibility in the new platform.  .**Many might say that the collapse of Bitcoin means the collapse of crypto.**
1
You are correct.  Unfortunately Bitcoin cannot be helped by QAN’s tech. However, other projects can.  Trust must be built for any new tech and company breaking into a space.  QAN’s tech is already protecting a European Union country (we don’t know which one yet due to the proprietary tech and NDA’s.) And yes you are correct, if there is a major crack of Bitcoim’s code, crypto is dead.

Buy BTC regularly with the budget that you have, don’t overspend, don’t panic if price goes down, don’t try to trade its pumps and dumps, hold until you are satisfied with how much money you’ve made
2
Yup. Do not go jumping on everything you see rising. In fact, right now is a good entry on a lot of coins. For now, just set a weekly or monthly buy. Stick to BTC and do lots of reading. Then you can start to spread your wings a bit.

I remember my first crypto ownership being XRP that was a gift from a friend (like 30 bucks) and I received it on Nexo. Oh, the good old days! Anyway, BTC is what I would purchase now. Invest what you can afford to lose.

Get out of Coinbase.  Sign up with Kraken, buy Nano and withdraw it from the exchange into self custody Nano wallet like Nault.cc. Hold.  Nano is feeless and faster than everything else. Most energy efficient.  Zero inflation ...fully distributed fixed supply.

What if your budget is $0.25? ..Your going to need a better crypto than Bitcoin.  Nano is the answer. Feeless micropayments.

Buy on Coinbase store on a Ledger.  Never type your keys,  never take a photo of them and back them up on metal plates or a screw with washers.  DYOR but those are good places to start.

I always dislike that comment made by everyone trying to get into the crypto world. ..YOU ARE NOT LATE...If you were to ask anyone around you, work friends, people on transit, there is a very large portion that still have no idea what crypto is and its potential headed towards the future. Sure you know a handful of people who have put $1000 in BTC or ETH and lost it all so they gave it up and deemed it a scam..It’s still the very early stages. Think of social media in the 2010s, you’re having fun “poking” your friends on Facebook. There are still massive leaps ahead!..But in terms of your exchanges, do your research based on your location, needs and wants. Do you plan on day trading or just tossing some money in here and there? For me, I live in Canada so wealth simple was a great way for me to get started, Super simple, easy to use platform with low fee. I later evolved to using Kraken pro, it has an a user friendly side to it, but now starting to swing and day trade, it has a more complex side to it cater towards more needs, but also with lower fees than the rest.

that depends on your trading requirements, your priorities and also your countries regulation (as has been pointed out). My favorite platform is bybit, from my experience it's versatile, looks pretty safe to me, has good charting, options trading and has good bonuses (which are a priority for me). .Binance has only limited functions for me (in Germany).
2
Gemini
2
Nexo mostly because it is really user-friendly, everything I need is just a click away and there are no hidden fees or any like that, and the nexo card is a great addition to my day to day life, I even stopped using my bank card.
2
You’re still early 🤝 I personally use Binance and Trust wallet for storage.
2
Coinbase is my gambling app

The choice somewhat depends on the regulations in your country. .Generally speaking, Binance is the most popular and arguably the best option from a safety standpoint, since they’ve been in the game for a long time, they are constantly updating on-chain proof-of-funds and they are a company with no debt; however, in my country most of their functionality is restricted (basically anything other than Spot)..Personally I use Bybit and I’ve always had a good experience with it. They’ve also been around for some time now and they too have a frequently updated on-chain proof-of-funds...All of this assumes you’re interested in interacting with the crypto market through CEXs (Centralized Exchanges). ..If you instead want to go to DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges), you’ll need a wallet like MetaMask, which you can get as a browser extension, and then the DEX you use depends on which token you want to buy and the blockchain it lives on. I will warn you that while this option definitely gives you more flexibility, it will require you to learn quite a bit about blockchains and you will encounter risks which you wouldn’t on CEXs.
3
Cex I have good experience with Binance and Kucoin. ..Wallets - I used Metamask, Trustwallet and Rabby. ..More important is what you do to protect yourself from getting wallet hacked & tokens drained. ..Wallet app over a browser extension. .Don’t click any links in emails or DM on Telegram or Discord. .Use a quality VPN when you travel and are “forced” to use public wifi.

Coinbase

For established coins, go with Binance or Coinbase. For up and coming projects, use MEXC and Kucoin. For fresh launched projects, download trust wallet and connect to Uniswap or Pancakeswap.

Start on PayPal? Watch for Sony exchange news. They acquired an exchange im certain. Hsve a Sony coin coming. Sonieum token  not coin sorry. ..Which is great really cos manipulating is easy for Binance bnb. Ftx and kucoin. ..Sony will be like the first fully trusted day one exchange i think. But if Sony incorperates gaming in any way at all. Buy these Sony exclusive games receive reward. Or dream on. Crypto backed games on ps5. But even without that dream its still Sony. And japan honorable Japan. Its exciting. ..PayPal sells bitcoin for now though. Mayb sol. Ide do that if just wanting to poke around small scale toes wet. Dont rush in whilst its peak you'll only learn to hate it when it drops all gains made so far it probably will happen. I still have coins I saw drop 80% in 2022 after riding high 2021. ..Wait for a crash then get alittle more serious. Nickel n dime till then.

Coinbase with a Trezor wallet. The newest version holds BTC & SOL. It's open sourced & has no back door.

Binance

Kraken, Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase,... ..When investing always wait for the target coin to drop in value. Market is now bearish so it's a good time to invest...I suggest you to start on Binance or Kraken, lowest fees..When coin you invested loses value, don't sell, wait for value to go up. Just be patient...You can stack stable coins with APY 2-15%.

Buy on exchanges like kraken kucoin. Store on ledger....I dont trust Exchanges but if they got a quick fiatonramp i dont mind spending a little fee on it. Storing selfcustody.. I.learned that from CEL..

Did you miss the 'and why?' part?
2
Well yeah! There's this inspiring quote I read about investing..The best time to start investing was yesterday. The next best is now. 😀..I guess post 2020, the whole crypto buzz got killed and only the real ones stayed. The ones who invested or gambled just to ride the train got screwed, and that has just given the entire market a bad reputation. ..I plan to invest about 10% of my investments in crypto on a regular basis, and this is basically my "invest and forget" account. I already have a regular monthly investment in mutual funds and stocks. I only sell if I need the money or if the particular company I've invested in is doing absolutely badly. Otherwise, I'm in it for the long haul. ..I'm exploring exchanges particularly for India. There were lots which came up during COVID-19 pandemic, advertised heavily to get gullible folks to invest, and now have vanished. Govt came down heavily to regulate these players and put strict restrictions on false advertisements. But no real good app that is trustworthy. Checking out Binance or Coinbase since they still have good repute and also have a global presence. ..Thanks for the motivation man! I no longer feel like I'm too late in the game, especially since the Outlook is to make gains in the long term.

Title: Why exactly is this BTC cycle different ? (Beginner_
20
Bitcoin ETF
15
People have said “this cycle is different” for every cycle i’ve been apart of; this being my third.
14
The simple answer is because MARKETS are all cyclical, and as much as we try to pretend crypto is different, it really isn’t. It’s still driven by human beings. ..If you look at the stock market, it cycles through bull and bear cycles. Both must happen naturally to find some certain balance, but the numbers over time always goes up. It’s just the way it is. 
9
It's different because Institutions are buying heavily but discreetly, along with regulations being in favor of crypto.
7
The big difference is that "the halving cycle" is now a known thing in crypto circles and that affects market behaviours. Foreknowledge can be priced in,  but the supply shock can't. I think the projections of $180k are sound. Anything more would require a major event like a china flip or Tesla style enterprise investment. Even governmental stockpiling... if the US starts doing that - others will as well.
5
- price traded for weeks below the previous ATH in the last bear market. Never happened before..- price broke the current ATH before the halving. Never happened before..- the block subsidy is the lowest, ever. Thus the highest amount of coins are in circulation yet the least ever is being rewarded. Thats scarcity ..- TradFi is here. Tens of thousands of coins are being sucked into ETFs. Many will never come back to the open market again ..- This is the first US election cycle in which Bitcoin is part of the candidate’s campaign rhetoric. Harris isn’t saying much but Trump is. I’m not sure ‘crypto’ could swing the election as it’s not at that stage yet but it will be influential. Some people are single issue voters ..- the hash rate is exponentially higher than it was in mid 2020..- many ‘bad actors’ have been flushed out. That should result in less manipulation but truth is Bitcoin is still highly manipulated through all those rogue exchanges using derivatives ..- simply maturity. With each cycle Bitcoin matures as an asset class. It’s come a long way since 2020. Now imagine it it in 2030. It should be in the multi trillions as an asset class. At least $5tn
10
I don’t think it’s going to be much different...I predict a top somewhere around $150k by the end of 2025. It’ll be excellent but I don’t imagine we’re gonna get some mind blowing $350k bitcoin or anything.
15
Because I bought...Everytime I buy, it drops.
3
It isn't
3
I'm not sure if it is but I notice that nobody has given the answer that I was expecting, which is that BTC already reached an ATH *before* the halving. ..Some people think that that was it, we peaked and now are slowly heading down. I don't think that btw, but in answer to your question "why is it different?", I think that's a big one.
4
maybe because we have 5.5 % interest rate right now, and that hasnt happened since bitcoin was created
2
Its not different they just take longer.  But we dont know how much longer.  Remember when we had 72k btc and everyone thought it was a straight shot to 100k?  That was 6 months ago...with no indication in sight when the bull market will resume.  Could be another 6 months..that wouldn't be unreasonable
2
It is different because of that scene in Jurassic Park with that drop of water on that guys hand 🦖
2
It’s not
1
Cause of the stock market
1
The ATH came before the halving this time, that’s new
1
Usually takes 4-5 months after the halving to pump. We are now on month number 5. If we dont pump from here ill say its different.
1
If people can’t clearly identify something they’ll call it different but it never is that different. If we go lower, they yell we’re going to die. If go higher we’re going to the moon and if we go sideways we’re not going anywhere. The next day they’ll tell you “I told you so”. But the fact is they don’t know how different, what’s different but they’ll be so proud to tell you “I told you so” whenever one of their shouts become true
1
no such thing as cycles
1
The only difference in this cycle that I can see is that there is more institutional investors which can control the spot price (for only so long.) The people claiming this cycle is different are just invested monetarily and are speaking with emotions which is not ideal. Truth is, every cycle has its FUD and shit that will make you wanna sell. That's exactly what is expected, then once you sell, the price will go back up and you'll buy in higher. ..Tldr: This cycle is exactly the same and should play out very similar to the past 3 cycles. We're still early especially if you're banking on altcoins. They'll peak in 10-14 months historically speaking...
1
This cycle isnt different.   .All cycles are the same.  .You have small changes of course, but it is the same for now.
1
It’s not different
1
Definitely the ETFS has brought more main stream adoption like people have said but retail still are not searching in terms of google searches like they did 2017/2018. This BTC cycle will be very different though non the less, people are starting to ask more questions and you see it more and more in main stream media. Adoption is happening much quicker than the internet did and yes we are all still early. By 2028 the space will be very much different to today.
1
Nobody really knows shit in here because no one in here is a market manipulator or a really "big fish." Every single person in here is like you, giving and asking for opinions. Over time in the market, you can knowledge and experience, and hopefully, you make better decisions with that information each day, week, month, etc. depending on how you trade or "invest." This cycle is different for one major reason: Bitcoin made its All-Time-High (ATH) before the halving, instead of historically after. It made its ATH because of the ETF. That also makes things different. The ETFs have begun to truly legitimize BTC and its volatility is different this time around, which also affects the altcoins and the shit coins... maybe they are one and the same. Most of the altcoins have run, but according to the "experts' there is an altcoin season to come, and apparently, December is a good month... but honestly, it is very volatile and most everything in this space is just gambling. BE Aware...
1
Its game over for BTC. Easily manipulated. Stay away.
1
Bcos everybody thinks its guaranteed money right and it you expect it you dont get it. ..2021 was such a freak year way unnatural growth it could take 2-3 cycles especially with the economy climate forcast. ..Even tho crypto supposed to be a hedge against bad cash its not is it. No. People run from crypto even when cash doing so poorly. Its weird. ..Elon musk just got away with rugging everybody in 2021 that whole mess suckerd way too many into it who lost. ..Once bit twice shy. ..So we have big money thinking it can buy up last year ready to offload it this year next year but its not gonna happen. ..Retail investors vanished ETF is good but its not that good. Its mostly one account selling up to move it to other account. ..These companies had btc but now they want eft btc for some reason. ..Again crypto was supposed to be different self custody etc but nope. ..If you ask you dont get.
-1
^came here to say this. Institutional Money Makers aka price manipulators. That's what's different.

^This. BTC ETF's allows accessibility & signals adoption. More liquidity. Etc... ..Its good sign for the major players (BTC, ETH, SOL, ETC...) But memecoins will still be memecoins.

I try to be positive about crypto and have been in it since 2020  but I feel like it would take a strong economy and disposable cash for the market to pump that high. Am I wrong?

2
**I don't think there will be a significant impact except in legislative matters.** The market is full of manipulation and lack of transparency, and we have learned from the practices of all investors. The market has no regulations. Anyone with a lot of money can influence the market, as we've seen in the past.
2
Well the stock market does fine with all the inside traders, I mean politicians that pass laws governing companies, making trades before and after they pass laws influencing potential market value. ...But no I’m not worried about a billionaire with a diversified investment portfolio, I would like to see a severe crack down on ways all politicians can make money. $200k a year job doesn’t make anyone a 100 millionaire except in politics and that shit needs to stop.
2
It absolutely blows my mind how people get so focussed on bashing this dude while people that have been politicians FOR DECADES have been violating all kinds of laws, ethical standards, and profiting off their positions, WHICH SHOULD BE public servants! .I don't like him and I didn't vote for him FYI. Im simply calling out how hypocritical many of you are. You give a pass to all these politicians where it has been PROVEN time and time again that they've leveraged their positions for power and money, yet y'all stay quiet?? ..So no, in not concerned in the least bit the impact ONE MAN can have when our entire govt is corrupt, taking advantage of the system, and causing much more of an impact than simply he can.
2
Honestly we should be voting for Trump on purely moral grounds, but the pro crypto stuff is just icing on the cake.
1
**Yes**, he might take advantage of that! The market allows him to do so, especially since he has fans ready to jump in with him. *Don't forget that he sold limited edition shoes, and sold out immediately.*
2
But, sadly, way too many crypto investors are willing to sell the sould of the USA for a guy that is a proven pathological lier, and convicted felon, that tried to do a coup on January 6th, with a mob that wanted to kill his own Vice, for doing his legal duty. ..But they believe that Trump will magically create trillions of value in crypto , although he did nothing for it in 2016-2020. And they also say that Kamala will kill it, even if they did nothing either to do so in the last 4 years. ..If you go to 2016 and 2020 they believed exactly the same, and reality never changed their world perception
6
>Well the stock market does fine with all the inside traders, I mean politicians that pass laws governing companies, making trades before and after they pass laws influencing potential market value. ..There are rules to be followed, declaration of interests to be filed...Trump has always refused to filed these.
1
Agreed. It’s crazy that they believe anything this moron has to say. He’s in it for himself and they will only benefit IF their interest align. Otherwise he’ll scam them. Just like he’s scamming his voters now. Sad.
3
I googled “trump refuses to file declaration of interest” I got two pages of news results none were about my search. ..I don’t think politicians or their immediate family should be allowed to  trade stocks or invest in anything they can sway… public servants should serve to serve, not get filthy rich IMO
2
The point being made is MOST politicians take advantage of the system MUCH WORSE. I don't like the guy and didn't vote for him FYI so I'm not defending him. Im simply calling out the hypocrisy
1
[See here](https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns/index.html)..He refused to release his tax returns, among other things, to a House Committee...>  .I don’t think politicians or their immediate family should be allowed to  trade stocks or invest in anything they can sway… public servants should serve to serve, not get filthy rich IMO..Way too large.  It basically mean they would rely only on their income to retire.  You'd fail to attrack interesting candidates.  Anyone who has an opportunity to keep working in the private sector or with a well paying job would stay there.....I don't see a problem with it, so long as they don't own the stock on companys they regulate, or don't own the stocks directly.
2
ALL politicians have to file their tax returns and file a declaration of their interests when they join a committee...  .ALL Presidents have file their tax return upon entering office...ALL Presidents have been transparent with their finance and dealings, even the corrupt ones in the past...Except for Trump.
1
Based on historical evidence, it would be suicide. The smallest detail of his tax returns would be scrutinized at an atomic level and misinterpreted by those not qualified to have an opinion. He's a business mogul, his taxes are probably so complex that it would take a team of professionals to interpret them honestly. There are most likely underpayments made up for by overpayments and credits covered by arbitrary tax laws that nobody but a select few understand. Opponents will, as history has shown, contextualize the inequalities and exclude the balancing equalities. You don't want the truth. You want the dirt.
1
Bullshit excuse...His taxes aren't complex, he is dirty and he is not as rich as he pretends he is.  It's as simple as that...If he did not want anything to be misinterpreted, he should not have sought a public job that comes with obligations.
1
Yeah, that's why people vote for him. I feel like you're missing the point, and it's stressing you out. These people voted for and currently support who they consider to be an "insider" exposing the government for everything they've done. On the flip side, you have people supporting someone who will prosecute the "enemy" for everything they have done. The problem here is that the enemy being prosecuted is being prosecuted by the same enemy he is attempting to expose, a political orobourus of you will. Trump Snowdened himself, and he's facing it head-on. He could have fled years ago... the "other side" is running a massive campaign of disinformation and propaganda to prevent this guy from taking office... DNC has like 60 field offices in PA, Trump has 2, and it's still 50/50... whether his taxes prove he's wealthy or highly indebted is irrelevant except to discredit him, which is why my original point stands, you don't want the truth, you want the dirt. The truth doesn't serve you. The gossip and negatives do. I won't support a political movement that seeks the dirt on others in order to persecute them, that usually leads to persecuting before anyone even bothers to grab a shovel except to bury the remains of their own mistakes.
1
>you don't want the truth, you want the dirt. The truth doesn't serve you. The gossip and negatives do...It's not gossip when it's factual...It's negative because it's who he is.  He likes to brag and lie...  .I do not care what is supporters want or like.  I care about equality of treatment between all candidates.  Equity. Everyone should be subject to the same rules.  What is not allowed for Harris should also not be allowed for Trump.  Simple as that...But that is not Trump...It is irrelevant what you and his other supporters think, that's how things should work in a proper functioning democracy.  What you want, is how things work in China and Russia: one set of rules for the governing party, one set of rules for everyone else.
1
No, you want to bury him and punish him more than any normal person would be punished for the same. You foam at the mouth and get visceral when it comes to what you wish they would do to the guy, and don't hide it because you think everyone else thinks the same as you, and if they don't then they should suffer the same fate. There are zero "red-handed" convictions of the guy, just a wishlist of politically polarized interpretations and accusations, and if your type had access to his taxes, you would add exponentially more politically polarized interpretations taken completely out of context. ..People aren't stupid. They easily see you clipping what Trump says and removing the context nearly every day, and your incessant need to constantly run around telling everyone to look at it does just one of two things: reveals that you are just a mouthpiece regurgitating fake talking points(propagandist), or a complete imbecile that actually thinks it's true.
1
He has been accused and he has been tried.  He had the opportunity to defend himself, he still has...He has been convicted so far in each case that was brought to trial.  That his how justice works...  .Hilary Clinton was "convicted" by the popular opinion to the chant of "lock her up" for what crime?  For a crime Donald Trump did repeatedly once he took office: use her own device to conduct official business...  .What are the criminal accusations laid at Hilary Clinton so far?  What has been discovered by the intense scrutiny of her e-mails that deserved to lock her up?..What is Joe Biden guilty of in the case of Hunter Biden?  What have the Republicans witch hunt managed to find?..Nothing.  Nothing at all...  .But when one of their own is totally corrupt, they close rank and protect him.  That's what they always do. They are strong on moral values, until they get caught in an airports restroom with another dude.  Then it doesn't matter so much.  Cheating on your wife is a national past time for Republican politicians.  Giving handjobs in theater too.  But god forbid a man or a woman could be gay, that would destroy America.  They must be stoned immediately.  Even worst if they are trans, they should be nailed to the Cross...Like I said, I want Republicans to be held to the same standards they want others to adhere to.

can you be more specific because both sides definitely support usdt

I think in case Coinbase doesn't support a network, you can transfer your Coinbase wallet to a different wallet that supports that network by using your recovery phrase or private key. If you send USDT on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP20), you can import your wallet into MetaMask or Trust Wallet, both of which support multiple networks.  .  .***Pls Verify the information with the support team to confirm its accuracy.***

I recall seeing a video recently about a guy who sued Coinbase after he made the mistake of sending USDT from Binance to Coinbase via Solana. Not sure how that all ended

Gotcha yeah coinbase only does tether on eth. if support can’t revert it for you, this may help although I’ve never used it myself https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-announces-support-for-asset-recovery-on-bnb-smart-chain-and-polygon

I did this with nexo 2 years ago. They finally added bnb support and I got all my money back. If is in a wallet you control you can move it to another provider and possibly get it back. If it’s on Coinbase exchange it’s probably gone until they add support for USDT Bep 20.

Title: Is trading futures with high leverage really profitable?
18
"Almost every financial blow-up is because of leverage" - Seth Klarman.."Leverage,  concentration and illiquidity are the three things that can kill you" - Steve Cohen.."Leverage can never turn a bad investment into a good one, but it has the potential to turn a good investment into a bad one" - James Montier
11
Nope. Lost my capital 100% 3 times doing futures.
7
Most of us look at Leverage wrong...Leverage is a Line of Credit...1000 at 100x is 100,000...$1000 in contracts is $11...Cross Margin. Prevents early Liquidation. ..A well managed 100k Portfolio, Hedge Mode, Cross Margin, Low Bets can be very profitable...Don't go too deep and you can afford to be wrong a few times, hedge and martingale out.
10
Depends on your strategy. I regurarly put on 50x, 75x and sometimes even 100x positions. Its really just an extension of your account. It gives you the ability to limit risk (with cryptoexchanges for example - you can trade your full size, ie 5k usd or sth and only put up 50 of your own dollars to the exchange. If you get liquidated, well shame, you lost 50, thats 1% of your size...If you get a sniper entry and your margin can sustain it, you can get interesting results. If you dont know how to trade profitably, you get fucked 50x, 75x or 100x faster!
10
Stick to what you're currently doing.
3
20x is small if you’re trading intraday, it’s massive if you’re trying to HODL long term. depends on your strategy..Remember that leverage shouldn’t be used to increase your position size, it just allows you to keep less money on the exchange while still trading positions you would with your cash on hand.

stay away from it bro
2
Well high leverage can be profitable but very risky. 20x really isn’t that crazy for quick trades, unless you’re already putting down $10k as collateral. .20-40x is really about my sweet spot for small time frames but if 5-10x works for you then if just stick with it. Really the risk is more about how much of your total portfolio you risk per trade.
1
It works sometimes but at the end you lose the biggest position and lose all.
1
Buddy dont overleverage. Main goal of trading is to make rich richer and poor poorer. I trade automaticaly on _easy_ platform i wont mention name, and they _stacks_ risk to 1% per trade. Which is max recommended because this teleg _ _bot_ avoid big drawdawns. Which by math can occur naturaly. If drawdown is huge you cannot recover fast.
1
I experimented with 10x for 3 months looking to trade only 4 hr candle. It was zero loss net. Then I tried 1day candle for 2 months. It was a loss . Lost 20% of investment.  Then I tried 30min candle only once a week for every alternate week for 3 months.It was net positive by 50%. Well, changing your strategies by market weather.
1
High/low leverage in cross doesn't matter. Its your position size that can get you rekt..Read about Risk Management.
1
If you know what you're doing it can be. But it's wrecked many people.
1
If you want to try leverage dont risk more then 1 or 2% per trade..I lost so much money it hurts so bad, I lost my mind after a few high leverage trades went well..It can be done, but only by the 3% of really good traders..Better to just trade spot, if you want to trade leverage goto a site that gives you a funded account if you can pass the tests, this will cost you a 100$ instead of your entire account
1
It's gambling. Nothing more, nothing less
1
Also extremely risky remember that
1
I use leverage for all my trades, but I’m very particular with how I do it and I always manage my risk with discipline...The way I use leverage, I have stop losses and profit targets on my limit orders, and I simply let the trades play out, I don’t move my stops, and every single trade I make is risking less than 1% of my account...This process actually ***reduces*** my risk. Why? Because it allows me to place multiple limit orders on lower timeframes and diversify the types of instruments and setups I’m trading, so I don’t have to pile all my cash into one single trade hoping it works out. The higher my sample size, the more likely I’m going to get the expected results from my strategy. I’m never risking my entire account. Ever...Leverage is just a tool. Abusing it can be very costly. But if it’s used effectively as part of a sound business strategy, then it can be very beneficial.
1
One scam wick and you’re toast. .Every time I’ve used high leverage I’ve had my testies removed from my body.
1
Leverage is for institutions..They already have a lot of funds and they can do the move further they want in their direction
1
10x is maximum, 3-5x is normal. I would say stick to what you are doing as well you should understand that futures markets are highly manipulated by the exchanges due to liquidation fees ✌️
1
It’s all a gamble unless you have a working crystal ball
1
Hint: AVOID!!!
1
Of course it is. It’s also incredibly risky.
1
Yes! It is EXTREMELY profitable.
1
Yes! It is EXTREMELY profitable.
1
Forget the multiples of growth. Take money out of the account every month for living expenses but also, in case the broker goes sideways u have most of your cash...I do it every month.
1
Do leverage trading only if you have better understanding about position sizing and proper risk management. In my opinion you must stick to spot itself if it gives you fair returns in terms of percentage. Only take safe bets while doing future/leverage trading backed with proper technical analysis.
1
Anything above 20x leverage is donating money to the exchange. Your margin ratio will be small and liquidation risk will be high. Not worth it. I have only ever made money with one 50x leveraged position the rush was great but it ruined my trading mentality
1
you just answered your own question yourself......you already know the answer

High leverage is never profitable on long term…
-2
Sounds like you had no risk management in place. Stop losses? Who needs them, am I right?

This!
0
This is shite advice
-1
You are so wrong it depends on the trading strategy..But in general the higher the leverage the higher the budget that you need.
1
Yeah that’s a mistake on my part that I don’t use SL.
1
Exactly 75x, 50x, 100x is gambling with 1% or even less odds
1
Yes but 99% of people haven’t any notion of the risk, and leverage is gambling for people like that.
1
Hey at least you know it’s a problem. The biggest turning point in my trading was realizing that I do in fact have an edge but I just need to accept my losses as part of my overall trading system...It’s like being a professional poker player. You know you can make money but you also know that you’re going to lose money on a lot of hands in the process.
2
That in my opinion is irrelevant because you either know to trade and be profitable or you don't and you lose money regardless of the leverage.

Shipping.. And usability...There are plenty of big MC coins out there with large "communities" of die hard fans. But the rest of the space knows they're not going anywhere. And it's usually followed up with the same arguments found on YouTube and tiktok...I try and use a chain/project before investing. And seeing progress in the project over time...So many people are just bag holders, expecting other people to "use" the coin/token so that their bags are pumped
1
Unique use cases, strong communities, and constant development are what project interesting. First movers like ETH and LINK have applied these approaches, giving them an edge in the space. BTC L2 is a new narrative and EXSAT's unique proposition as a docking layer makes it interesting. The project ensures enough liquidity in BTC L2 needed to drive mainstream adoption.

Yes, never launch code you don't understand or if you're not a current developer in the space. Secondly, no one with an edge will give out code for free. Just look into MEV bots on GitHub, there are no working or competitive repos... Because they are worth millions in technology alone
7
Most likely a scam! ..Best I've found not to be is XCeption bot on telegram it has a mev bot to use if you want ether (Need to still trade well to make money)
1
I figured as much :(, I just launched the prompt on chatgpt “write me the code for a smart contract on ethereum to automatically hunt for sniping opportunities to earn ethereum. Solidity only”, do you reckon that this…. “Clean” version of the code would work?
1
Absolutely not. If you're not a programmer, using AI to help with programming is currently an unviable solution. Just learn to code and then you can use AI to help, but most IDEs now input very widely used formats automatically if you use the right extensions..But again, it won't be competitive no matter what you find online. You would need to understand how Ethereum and Uniswap work at the lowest levels before you could even build anything profitable. Just think, there are math genius' and multi decade experienced developers you would be competing with.

Not manipulation in the literal, traditional sense. But it still could be classified as manipulation nonetheless. ..Wash trading, liquidity hunts, stop runs, intentional traps, bullish/bearish media runs, pre economic news liquidity traps, etc. ..These things obviously happen in all markets, but it is much more frequent and used to a greater magnitude by large supply holders in crypto..Very easy to “manipulate” price on a speculative asset that falls into a grey zone on intrinsic value interpretation. If there’s no “real” valuation models to anchor price, it’s the Wild West.

It will cost him many millions more and there’s no guarantee, period. Just seems like a lost cause at this point.

Lmao why everything has to be AI:..For the past ten years, Howells has been in talks with the council, offering a plan for an eco-friendly excavation using cutting-edge AI technology to locate the hard drive....I bet there’s no AI involved just some smart well design search pattern, more based on physics (how to detect a hard drive) than an actual AI algorithm.

Does anyone else find this story strangely terrifying? Or maybe unsettling is a better word. The thought of casually throwing away just some normal hard drive and then later realizing it’s worth literally hundreds of millions of dollars, then spending the rest of your life obsessing over it to the point of trying to dig through a landfill seems like torture. ..I’m sure this guy has lost his mind at least a little bit at this point. If that happened to me I’d have a hard time ever focusing on anything else. Someone could probably make a good psychological horror movie based on this story, or like a black mirror episode.

I was (apparently I found out years later) one of the largest Ethereum ICO investors at $10,000. ..33,000 ETH. ..My wonderful financial advisor told me to sell everything at $2.60.  Because it had been over a year with no v1 release, and everyone was calling ETH “vaporware”. ..I haven’t moved on. :)

This is a fun website Lol. I wonder what the % chance of landing on a key with a balance >0 would be

Just curious, what do you actually do once you land on a key with more than 0. Just yank it? Don’t you need to know the private key as well?
2
i always wonder but never bother to ask this hypothetical because people get immediately butthurt. but lets say you came across one of those wallets with no movement in 10 years and only deposits. would you feel guilty taking the bitcoin? i'd have a hell of a debate whether to take it or not if it seemed abandoned.

If the plates are intact the data is still there. When you wipe a hard drive the data isn’t deleted. The headers on the data is removed so the computer can’t see the data which makes it believe it’s been deleted. This was true for the older plate HDD not sure about SSD’s. When the data is written to the plates it’s there forever unless you write over it.

I would transfer it immediately- any address.   I would hit the dice roll and pick another random address, record it's private key on a piece of paper, and send it there so it's not connected to any deterministic wallet seed.  Maybe use someone else's device, or a device in library to do it... Idk...Imagine finding a Binance address, or a Coinbase Vault address with Black Rock's ETF balance. Suddenly it's just gone and now sitting on a piece of paper is some dipshit's nightstand. Hilarious. Imagine the chaos... "Where the fuck are the funds, Coinbase?!!". ..You couldn't ever use it.  I'd probably want to give it back at some point, after convincing myself of some foolish plan to leverage it. This would be a cool movie plot.  In the midst of the Coinbase / Black Rock meltdown- which inside they would all assume it was an inside job and accuse each other to the level of murder and mayhem, then suddenly random messages come from me under some handle that imply there is a third party involved and they have to sort that out- are they being gaslit by each other- or do they need to collaborate to figure out who this is?..In my ending I give it back to some fanfare, with a BlackRock making a charitable contribution to a public interest cause, so it's a win win. A twist I'd give up the paper with the private key, only for them to realize it is the public key and I wrote down the wrong one not knowing the difference. 👍. Oops.

1) Hard disk drives absolutely degrade if left to sit on a shelf for years. 10 years may be long enough to have been corrupted beyond recovery..2) This particular hard drive is in a landfill, a far less ideal environment than on a shelf.  Most likely it's been exposed to acidic leachate.

Untrue.. depends on the drive. Helium HDDs are hermetically sealed, which technically were selling back in 2013 but unlikely as a consumer product.

2
He had been watching me for about 2 years already with crypto, and saw me go through a bull run without cashing anything out.  😆 ..So he had as his mentality, “if you don’t take this $65,000 profit and run with it you’re crazy“...He’s a financial advisor. They don’t do risk.

I've dealt with a ton of hard drives. When you get corruption, it's usually a tiny fraction of percent of data. So a large movie couldn't be played without a hiccup, an individual file out of thousands is damaged (in actual examples, it was 1 file out of 100,000)...The bitcoin file is tiny. If there was 1 corrupted file, there is almost zero chance it is the bitcoin file...Hard drive plates might be damaged by extreme heat. But the other stuff wouldn't damage it. Rain would NOT damage the plates. A powered down hard drive lasts an order of magnitude longer. I store very old hard drives from 20 years ago and not a single one has an error. Because again, a powered down hard drive is not going to get them. That's not how they work...The corrupted ones were always hard drives that were slammed nonstop with reads and writes. I'm talking 24 hours acting as a media server for years straight. The read head is usually the problem, never the plates. A newer but heavily used hard drive will always fail before an ancient 20 year old hard drive kept in storage. It's not even close.
8
When you get corrupt data. Who’s telling you it’s corrupt the computer! I just understand how the old drives work.
1
He’s right. This is why formatted hard drives can still have data on it. Only the header portion is erased. The metal plates are actually quite tolerant to different conditions
-1
of course i’m not talking about the HDD i’m talking about the glass plates the data is stored on.

no chance it got wet? or something smashed it?
1
In a sense, yes.  You are correct that the data is still there when you “erase” a file.  That’s how data recovery tools work.  ..However, many things can affect the readability of a platter.  Things like moisture, heat, dirt, and magnets.  Among other things.  Get a platter hot enough and all those magnetized bits will get demagnetized.  Or the platter might warp.  Or both.  Get enough moisture in there and corrosion will do the work that heat couldn’t. Get dirt in there and even if the magnetic bits were readable, just getting the dirt out again might gouge a microscopic groove deep enough to render your data unreadable.  ..Magnets shouldn’t need an explanation.
5
Exactly.  The platters will lose data if left sitting long enough and can be damaged by contact with landfill leachate.  You're really daft.  That drive is toast after 10 years in a landfill.

1
>no chance it got wet?..Irrelevant. Especially when powered down, but even when powered up, pretty much all data would be recoverable...>or something smashed it?..Possibly, this is a real danger, however if you have a large budget for recovery even physically damaged platters will reveal most of their data...If you've ever had to dispose of hard drives by drilling or smashing them, you'd also know it takes quite a bit to physically damage the outer casing, too. Unless it was crushed by some machinery, chances are a lot would be recoverable
3
The platters are made of glass. Glass doesn’t warp from dirt heat or water. This is why all HDD gets crushed now instead of resold they are pretty  tough. Forget about the HDD it’s in. The plates would be removed in a clean room setting and put into another machine that reads them.
1
I have drives that I have treated like straight shit old 15 year old IDE HDD dropped and Stored in a High heat GPU mine Fire right up and work. Had one last year with an old lite coin mining wallet from 2013. What the person I sent it to told me is that the data never really dies until it’s crushed.  I have faith and I think it’s worth the fight.

1
As someone said, they weren’t always.  Looks like the transition to glass really took off in 2000. Most of the platters I encountered were metal but I stopped destroying drives for security around 2000.  ..Still, experts in hard drive recovery have this to say about water intrusion: “[[Hard disk platters] actually corrode very readily, which is why the environmental spec prohibits more than 90% RH (relative humidity)](https://www.gillware.com/resources/water-damaged-hard-drive-handling-guidelines/).”..I’d say after all this time in a hot humid landfill, those patters ate toast.
2
>The platters are made of glass...Didn't used to be. I allegedly destroyed a couple around 2010 by tearing open the casing and expirementing with the disks. They were all some type of metal that could be melted with a propane torch.
1
Survivorship bias is a hell of a drug.  The person who told you that is flat out wrong.  Even in perfect conditions, hard drive platters WILL eventually lose data.
0
You're market making? Providing liquidity both ways works pretty well if you have a good management system.
1
Data retention on a plate drive is 20-40 years depending on manufacturer not sure what you’re reading. I think SSD are 9 because it’s hot data and not written on a plate.  Tape storage lasts 15-30 years the old stuff worked longer.
1
Ah so we're getting somewhere.  Your "forever until crushed" is 20-40 years in \*ideal\* conditions according to you now.  I threw out the number 20 years as being a possible starting point for magnetic failure of the platters resulting in unrecoverable data, again in \*ideal\* conditions.  So, it seems we have the same sources...Now let me pose the question, how familiar are you with landfill operations and the subsurface conditions inside the landfill?   Do you know the logistics of what it takes to dig into a landfill?  I actually am very familiar with landfill operations and subsurface conditions, and I've done exploration excavations in closed landfills.  20 years ago, it cost $2M to dig up 1/4 acre of landfill to a depth of 25 feet.  Environmental concerns aside, it's a health and safety nightmare...There's a better than a 50/50 chance that drive was exposed to an industrial electromagnet to sort scrap iron and steel from the debris to recycle.  There's a 100% chance that drive was subject to excessive g forces from rough handling, and a really good chance that it was directly run over with heavy equipment.  It's a long shot that the drive survived all the potential physical and magnetic abuse with data intact up to the point of final burial, where it would be compacted with heavy equipment...But let's assume the drive made it that far intact and still has recoverable data.  Now it's soaking in a soup of acidic fluid carrying a high concentration of metallic cations and some amount of organic solvents.  I can 100% guarantee that a consumer drive of that era wasn't a sealed device.  Even if it was sealed, all containers leak eventually and I'm going to point back to rough handling and tell you the odds that seal was compromised is greater than zero.  Now we have the perfect conditions to etch or corrode the platters in a very short amount of time.  ..Odds that drive has recoverable data isn't zero, but it sure is close.  Given the cost of landfill exploration, low odds of success, and potential environmental consequences this simply isn't worth the effort.

They have 4000+ bitcoins for sale. The minimum deposit to participate in the auction is $200k. They are selling them in blocks, the first 2500 are in blocks of 500 coins, and the next 1000 are in blocks of 100. The last 500+ coins are to be sold in blocks of 50.

Interesting timing now that the ETF's will allow for short sellers to crash the price.

the more centralized powers dump, the more people gain. No one controls bitcoin. Owners today would feel the pressure to sell at some point so Bitcoin can be in hands of people who want it more

Stupid take. Bitcoin futures were released at the end of the last halving cycle. ETFs were released before this cycle began. One of those is actually useful for affecting price and timely provided for shorting while the other not so much.

When you buy 1 IBIT you're buying 1/80160000 of 49952.32 bitcoin. If Blackrock loses the keys, you can sue. The difference from FTX is they're good for the liability unlike some random guy. ..If you take their bitcoin holdings and multiply it by the price of bitcoin and divide by the number of shares you will find out if the price you're paying for an IBIT share is fair. Spoiler it's actually underpriced and buying IBIT right now is cheaper than buying spot.

Fuckers predicting the collapse of the worlds financial institutions saying that...A bitcoin being worth 6,000,000 ain't worth much when a loaf of bread is costing 100,000,000...As much as crypto is great and all, if bitcoin is worth a million in 6 years then our society is fucked. A series of events that makes BTC worth that much ain't going to be great for the average joe soap. The dollar would have to devalue something dramatic and that would only mean economic collapse or world war...Inflation 1000% or something, fuck dorsey, fuckhole.

Bitcoin gains have historically caused no effect on the price of living. So why would a 10000% increase cause massive inflation?  Bitcoin is 3600% up from its start at thw moment. No link to inflation? When BITCOIN was $10US ans someone said it would be $63, 000 in 10 years, would you have said there would be an economic crisis?

Tall candidate, the US holds anything of value and hoards it. It's what an intelligent government does to keep the dollar strong. Anything of value gets hoarded. I don't kbow why your so surprised that some bitcoin will get hoarded as well! America's annual GDP is 25 Trillion and bit coin has a cap of about 1.3 Trillion. On top of the GDP is the vast wealth accumulated worth hundreds of Trillions of dollars. That's why they hoard stuff and your getting paranois because a couple billion in bitcoin is getting put away?

Once you've had a taste of newer, faster networks that offer delectable DeFi dApps and smart contracts, it's hard to go back to slow, boring old Bitcoin..> .> ####**Bitcoin doesn't excel at anything**.> .> **Poor Medium of Exchange**.> .> Bitcoin is much too slow. It has a max throughput of **3-4 TPS** that takes **30-60 minutes for probabilistic finality**. It used to have a max throughput of 7 TPS, but that has gradually fallen over the years after exchanges started using batch transactions. It's much too slow to be used for point-of-sales merchant transactions. No one is ever going to want to **wait 30-60+ minutes** at a cash register for a transaction to go through. Block times average 10 minutes, but they are very variable. 14% of blocks take longer than 20 minutes, and 5% are longer than 30 minutes [[Source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/25293/probablity-distribution-of-mining/43592#43592)], causing stress for those waiting for confirmation. And if there's congestion, some transactions can get stuck in the mempool for hours or days..> .> It's orders of magnitude slower than newer networks like Polygon PoS or Algorand, which can [process 4000+ TPS with sub-4s of deterministic finality](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/basics/why_algorand/), with transaction fees well under a penny..> .> Even TradFi now has payment systems like Africa's M-Pesa, UK's Faster Payments, Australia's NPP, the US's upcoming FedNow, and Clearinghouse's RTP, which provide **near-instant** payments and peer-to-peer transactions **without fees**..> .> **Unstable Store of Value**.> .> Bitcoin is too volatile to be considered a stable Store of Value. It lost up to 80% of its purchasing-power during previous bear markets. It's also NOT a good stock market hedge since it often moves with the stock market..> .> **Lacks smart contracts and DeFi**.> .> Bitcoin doesn't support DeFi smart contracts with its very basic Bitcoin Script. There are smart contract protocols that use Bitcoin like Stacks, but they are very disconnected from Bitcoin..> .> ####**Difficult to achieve widespread global adoption**.> .> At 4 TPS, Bitcoin can only make ~345K transactions/day. There are ~8B people in the world today. If Bitcoin grows to the size of 1% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 230 days. **If Bitcoin usage grows to 10% of the population, each person can make an average of 1 on-chain transaction every 6.3 years.** To achieve 10% world adoption, everyone would need to solely be using centralized exchanges and not interacting directly with the blockchain itself..> .> ####**Issues with the Lightning Network**.> .> **Not even the Lightning Network could save Bitcoin** because opening and closing a channel requires 2 on-chain transactions. Whenever the directional capacity of a channel is exceeded, it will need to be rebalanced, or be closed and re-opened. You can't expect people to store months of funds on a single channel. Half of the US is living paycheck to paycheck and would unlikely be able to keep channels open for long periods. If even 1% of the world used the Lightning Network and opens/closes their channels twice a year, the Bitcoin Network would become completely congested..> .> **Not a true Layer 2**.> .> Similar to Plasma channels, **the Lightning network is not considered a true Layer 2 because it lacks global state.** There are many nodes that are not connected to the rest of the network, and onion routing issues can cause nodes to be disconnected from the rest of the network. **Channels only work if everyone's online.** If you're offline, others can force-close your channel, leading to a 1-week wait time where the channel's funds are locked and inaccessible..> .> **Meant for small transactions**.> .> Lightning is optimal for small transactions. The larger your transaction, the higher the fees you have to pay to route it through the network. As of March 2023, the [average channel capacity](https://1ml.com/statistics) is only 0.07 BTC, and the average node capacity is only 0.33 BTC. It's not uncommon for a large 1-BTC transaction to cost $2-10 in fees to route through multiple nodes in the Lightning Network due to limited channel capacity, which can make it more expensive than L1 Bitcoin fees. Also, the total value stored on public Lightning channels account for under [0.02% of Bitcoin's total locked value](https://1ml.com/). .> .> **Partially-centralized, low-security layer**.> .> Most people just connect to centralized nodes in a spoke-hub network topology to gain access to high-capacity nodes. Even though [average capacity is getting bigger](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity), the [number of public channels has been on the decline since 2021](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-channels), meaning that Lightning is becoming more centralized..> .> **Channels require rebalancing**.> .> One of the biggest problems with opening channels is that they **start out with zero incoming liquidity**. Anyone who opens a channel starts out with a metaphorical "full cup of water". They can't receive any more water until they first empty the cup a little. And they can only receive additional water equivalent to the amount they removed. Similarly, people who open new channels to the Lightning network need to find a way to spend their Sats safely so that they can have incoming liquidity. Merchants and Lightning node providers often have a lack of incoming-liquidity while consumers who only spend usually run out of outbound liquidity..> .> There are ways to rebalance your channel capacity, but it usually costs money to pay for a service to provide that liquidity, and it can be as expensive as a $1 fee per $1000 of liquidity..> .> ####**The disadvantage of soft forks**.> .> The major downside of Soft forks is that they require new versions of the software to maintain backwards-compatibility with older versions, which leads to **technical debt**. This significantly slows down the adoption of new updates, which now often take 3-6 years to gain the majority..> .> Due to its soft forks, the Bitcoin network has to maintain a mismatch of all sorts of different address formats: P2PK, P2PKH, P2SH, P2MS, P2WPKH, Nested P2WPKH, P2PKH, P2WSH, and P2TR. At the start of January 2023, [only 1% of transactions were using Taproot-compatible addresses](https://transactionfee.info/charts/inputs-types-by-count/) while 65% were still using inefficient legacy addresses from before 2017..> .> **Almost no one is using addresses newer than the 2021 update because none of the major CEXs support them**. Most exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) [don't support Bech32m addresses](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption#Exchanges), which means they still can't send to Segwit v1 and Taproot addresses, despite that it was [an update from 2021](https://bitcoin.org/en/releases/0.21.1/)..> .> In comparison, networks that hard fork for protocol updates don't have these incompatibility issues between versions. Everyone is working on the same version, which allows for consistency..> .> ####**Extremely inefficient and wasteful**.> .> To protect against Sybil and 51% attacks, Bitcoin's PoW consensus achieves greater security through greater **redundancy**. Out of a million miners, only one of them is producing the actual block while the rest of them are just wasting energy and electric waste. Full nodes also hold redundant copies of the blockchain ledger, leading to wasted storage..> .> In 2022, each block cost roughly $150-250K in energy to mine, which is equivalent to $80-120 of fees per transaction. The total Bitcoin network energy consumption of ~150 TWh/yr is equivalent to [**18-24 US nuclear power plants**](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-fast-facts-about-nuclear-energy). Another way of looking at this is that Bitcoin consumes about as much energy as all data centers globally [[Source](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-may-consume-as-much-energy-as-all-data-centers-globally)]..> .> In comparison, other distributed consensus methods such as BFT are [10^7 x more efficient for energy use](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-020-00656-x). There is a silver lining: the energy waste (and security) will slowly decrease with each block subsidy halving, at the cost of decreased security..> .> ####**Mining Pool Centralization**.> .> **The top 3 mining pools own 66% of the network hash rate** [[Source](https://btc.com/stats/pool)]. Individual miners have no financial incentive to run full nodes, so it's rare for them to be auditing their pool operators and won't notice attacks until it's too late..> .> This could be fixed with **Stratum v2**, but that's not available yet.

#Bitcoin Pro-Arguments.Below is an argument written by Nostalg33k which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round...> For this entry I'm going to update an overhaul my previous argument. This one is going to be very long but also address new things. I'm going to try to be more rigorous. Have fun ! .> .> Last entry:  .>   .>   .> Writing a Pro argument for Bitcoin in 2023 seems complicated because everything has been said... or did it?  .> Edit: I have a small bag of Bitcoin currently valued around 630 bucks. I am also invested in crypto around 2100 bucks which are always moving when Bitcoin is moving. Financial disclosure should be mandatory in these arguments =).> .> &#x200B;.> .> # Bitcoin: A small introduction. .> .> Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency. It was created by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. The creation of Bitcoin is some of the most weird mystery ever. No one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto really is. .> .> Bitcoin was started as a way to circumvent traditional banking in the wake of the financial crisis and the bail out of banks. Bitcoin relies on blockchain technology. Blockchain can be seen as an open book allowing anyone to know where is each fraction of Bitcoin ever. .> .> This blockchain is maintained through computer power. In a vulgar way: Bitcoin is mined by solving math problems. The maths problem becomes harder when more people are mining so that mining takes a fixed amount of time according to a timeline known to everyone. In order to respect this timeline, mining rewards are halved every few years. .> .> Since anyone who wants to validate transactions is forced to complete a very hard math problem (which becomes harder the more people are mining), no one can cheat in new transactions. Also, every other miner has a copy of the blockchain. Through making sure that no entity has 50% of the mining, you can stop nefarious actors from changing the blockchain. .> .> This is using cryptographic technology that I don't yet understand but you can read more about it here: .> .> [Bitcoin Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin).> .> Without delving more into the tech side of bitcoin. Which can also be explained through youtube videos here: [Bitcoin explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4).> .> The Metrics of Bitcoin are currently: 22400$ Per coin for a Market cap of 430 Bilions and a daily volume of 19 Billions. Bitcoin was shortly valued at 69000 usd during the ATH. .> .> Now let's dive into what is making Bitcoin so good. .> .> # Bitcoin is the king of POW: Why it matters and why we need a strong Bitcoin.> .> So as the title suggests it, the recent switch of ETH from POW to POS makes Bitcoin the sole serious POW cryptocurrency. In this write up, we are going to discuss the three main strength of Bitcoin, security, decentralization, and incentive for green energy production. Bitcoin is a highly liquid asset and has become nearly universally known as an investment. Many arguments have been made in favor of Bitcoin as an investment. It is interesting to delve into the limited supply of bitcoin.   .> ​  .> Of course, the main feature of Bitcoin is the Permissionless aspect. This allows the unbanked to use a P2P service. .> .> # 1) Bitcoin: The Apex of Security. .> .>   .> Bitcoin is ultra secure thanks to its use of Blockchain technology and the way it is verified through proof of work. To explain this let me quote IBM:  .> .> .> >  .> Public blockchain networks typically allow anyone to join and for participants to remain anonymous. A public blockchain uses internet-connected computers to validate transactions and achieve consensus. Bitcoin is probably the most well known example of a public blockchain, and it achieves consensus through "bitcoin mining." Computers on the bitcoin network, or “miners,” try to solve a complex cryptographic problem to create proof of work and thereby validate the transaction. Outside of public keys, there are few identity and access controls in this type of network.  .> .> .>   .> [IBM on Blockchain security](https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain-security).> .> ​  .> Mining is measured in Hashrate. Here is the explanation of Hashrate:  .> .> .> >  .> Hash rate, sometimes referred to as hashrate, is a measure of the computing power on a cryptocurrency network that serves as a key security indicator. It measures the total computational power used by a “proof-of-work” (POW) cryptocurrency network to process transactions in a blockchain.  .> .> .>   .> [USNEWS explains hashrate](https://money.usnews.com/investing/term/hash-rate#:%7E:text=Hash%20rate%2C%20sometimes%20referred%20to,process%20transactions%20in%20a%20blockchain).> .> ​  .> So if the hashrate measures the security of the network, one may asks themselves: "Did the security of Bitcoin slowed when the price fell ?"  .> [The hashrate is near the ATH and growing making Bitcoin more and more secure as it continues to build over time](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_network_hash_rate#:%7E:text=Basic%20Info,101.2%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago).> .> ​  .> So Bitcoin has never been as secure as it is today which makes it ultra valuable as a way to settle financial transactions. Yes holding Bitcoin for a long time is risky but using it as a medium to settle international transaction may currently be the securest and one of the best way to do so..> .>   .> While Bitcoin is safe... what if a big part fails ?  .> .> .> # 2) Bitcoin mining: Too big to fail..> .> So this write up could be seen as a POW write up, which it is to an extent. But Bitcoin offers its history and shows that it can survive the disparition of a big part of the network.  .> Decentralization allows for parts of the network to disappear and for the rest to take the mantle of securing the network. Yes, mining pools may grow too large for their own sake BUT in the end (nothing even matters) Bitcoin is heavily decentralized. It is so decentralized that, when China (which had a big part of Bitcoin mining) banned mining, Bitcoin just went through like nothing happened. Yes the hashrate fell a bit, the value too, but if we look back, it was nothing extraordinary..> .> The resilience of Bitcoin is largely due to the fact that the hashrate symbolizes competition=> If the hashrate falls, then it is more profitable for other miners to keep mining or for new miners to start mining. This balance is what makes Bitcoin very resilient.   .> ​  .> So if Bitcoin is highly secure and if it can survive part of the hashrate going bye bye, what makes it so good? What is the difference with any POW Cryptocurrency right now?  .>   .> .> .> # 3) Bitcoin: propping up the green energy sector..> .> POW uses energy. One of the biggest concern about POW is the energy. While Ethereum was using GPUs and was asic resistant. Bitcoin mining is built differently. A long time ago, under oath, people discussed the environmental impact of Bitcoin Mining and I made a post explaining what was said:  .> ​  .> The Energy Fud Was Killed  .> The most important thing that happened: The narrative that Bitcoin is too energy intensive was totally reversed.  .> Experts of the sector explained that, Wind Farms and Solar Farms, have a variable load. This variable load means that sometimes they lose money because they produce too much and there is not enough demand. Bitcoin mining provides a variable base load for these projects. What it means is that, mining can be turned on and off depending on demand. It was revealed that most of these wind and solar farms would simply not exist without Bitcoin Farming as baseline customers.  .> There are still miners that are using coal plants and fossil fuel but the leaders of the industry are developing in tandem with the green energy sector..> .> My write up about the congressional hearing is still true and thanks to the infrastructure act, green energy will continue to grow and to be cheap. This will allow for a better mining infrastructure.   .>   .> [My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/s99phv/yesterday_one_of_the_most_bullish_events_ever/)  .> .> .> #..*****..Would you like to learn more?

You believe that if Bitcoin has a similar marketcap to gold it will mean our economy will be in collapse...I'm not convinced...If pension funds, and hedge funds decide to put small % allocations into Bitcoin this could happen without inflation.
32
But couldn’t the price also go parabolic not just due to inflation but because of a massive inflow of worlds capital to the asset? Maybe a dumb question

Finally someone talking some sense, I tried to explain the same thing to people in the Shiba sub when they say it's going to hit 1 dollar..... Like I'm sorry guys but you really really don't want to see what the world is like if Shiba is 1 dollar

Yeah, this mf said one of the stupidest things ive read about btc. 1 mil at current per coin is enough to dethrone all equity markets. Not possible in the next 6 yrs unless the world goes to shit. Guy did not do his DD properly

Respectfully, the crypto currencies are decentralised cause practically no effect on inflation or the dollar. The past 10 years it has risen 3,600% and has a Return Of Interest rate at 98,000,000..These unheard of gains in the history of currency has virtually no effect on an currencies outside the decentralised community. If it went to 1 million it is another 1400% or there about. It's done way Moore that that already. However if you disagree? Start hoarding food for your inflation nightmare.
1
But if BTC reaches 1MM it would mean it is closer to fix the economy, because the problem with inflation is actually fiat being controlled by national banks/reserves without real backing... So a a super high priced btc is actually good news, not the other way around.
-1
Your wrong .. blame american goverment
-2
Jack definitely has vested interest. Having said that, I think he actually believes his claim. He’s been a bitcoin bull longer than most of us
1
It's not that Bitcoin would cause inflation, it's that inflation results in a higher USD price per BTC due to USD being worth less than it was before...Part of BTC's rise in price is also due to inflation...e.g. if BTC goes from $10k to $20k, it can be due to BTC rising in value OR USD falling in value (i.e. inflation).
3
Ah yes. I remember the lessons of World War 3 well.
1
He’s a clown
3
More importantly, the fact that bitcoins vanish constantly with people loosing their seed phrase, giving unclear legacy instructions or just plain forgetting about it. If you wait long enough, bitcoin will just disappear...The chain will still exist of course. But the scarce segments that still have an identifiable owner will be so few that it doesn’t matter.

Or the US dollar loses dominance and Bitcoin gets to a million purely because the USD loses its value thus requiring a larger value to purchase said coin,

You seem to forget gold is in every smart phone, every computer, every AI anything, used for jewelry and very expensive clothes. Its value is in what it enables us to do which is become technologically advanced. Bitcoin is out here just making people dumber and it doesn’t even do its own job as good as almost any other crypto including some meme ones.

It's not 90% but it's such a high number that your point is still relevant. The FEDs QE and liquidity policy is not literally "printing" money so it's best not to describe it like that...I'm not sure if "lost" is the right word either, a voluntary retreat from globalization has been happening for over a decade. We are further along that road than you imagine IMO.

You're not making sense....The dollar influences BTC, not the other way around......

Assuming 22M BTC in circulation. Is there a decent forecast of how many will actually be valid and not lost into the ether by that timeframe?

Because Bitcoin has been one of the top gaining assets year over year. It has beaten out every other major asset in growth percentage. ..I'm not actually making this up though, the largest pension fund in the world is looking into adding Bitcoin to it's investment portfolio...https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/03/19/japans-trillion-dollar-pension-fund-considers-bitcoin-for-diversification/?sh=5ce26c355d30..They aren't the only one, many other pension funds are looking into it as well. ..Like Arizona State pension: ..https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/arizona-state-senate-considering-adding-bitcoin-etfs-to-retirement-portfolios..If they start, they will start small 3-5%

BTC's value is independent of the dollar. The value of the dollar is going down in comparison to the value of BTC, hence btc/$ go up.

There’s 19.7 million BTC in circulation right now..By the year 2034, BTC will be 25 years old and 20 million BTC will be in circulation of the 21 million maximum supply...It will take an additional 100 years for the bitcoin miners to mine the remaining 1 million BTC...Price of BTC goes up when the difficulty to produce 1 BTC doubles every 4 years.   Aka “the halving”...The very last bitcoin won’t be mined for at least another 110 years. That’s beyond our lifetime.

Should say wars are looming

It’s not a doom and gloom scenario though, the USD is dominant because of oil and gold which is bought and sold in USD on the global exchanges. When this shift potentially takes place, so will the western world’s financial dominance. I’m a Canadian and I hope this doesn’t happen lol

Hard to believe. Same company that announced a high interest checking account on CNBC and had it immediately shut down because it wasn't SIPC approved...https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/sipc-chief-raises-concerns-to-sec-about-robinhoods-free-checking-accounts.html..I remember when they launched and had all of these problems. It was like watching an 8th grade class playing "Let's start a business" and it looks like they are still at the same level of business understanding. Well done Vlad... time to dust off the "as a small boy from Bulgaria" line to cover your incompetence.
24
Here's some more bad news. Kraken, Binance and others I've looked into charge a ridiculous flat fee for ETH and their Tokens. $8 for any USDT transaction. $6 for an ETH transaction. I've done enough research to the point where I have a database recording transaction gas fees every ten seconds...Rarely do they exceed what the sites charge for fees. RH might be charging a % instead of real gas fees. Bottom line, they all do it. RH seems to be among the worse though...I ran into this when I transferred 100 USDT to one of my wallets, was shocked that gas was $8. Then went into the rabbit hole.

Are you trying to tell us Vlad isn’t in this to help out the little guy …. I’m shocked

Here's what I have found while developing a P2P exchange. It is not difficult to obtain gas prices from the Ethereum server. It does take a bit of finagling in order to get it right. As well, when the gas prices are too high, clients still want to receive their withdrawals and they mostly don't care about the gas fee unless it is extremely high...Basically, it takes a lot of actual development to build a system that can save money on the gas fees, but it is not impossible. We're still working on it...I would not recommend one site over another as it seems to me they are all pretty much taking the easy way out and charging a flat fee for gas. What I would say is; try to avoid small withdrawals. Figure out what you're willing to pay for gas and then never withdraw less than that amount. Or try to...They are normally charging $8 for a USDT withdrawal, if you withdraw 80 USDT, you will pay 10% gas fees. If you withdraw 800 USDT, then your gas fee is only 1%. Right now, this is the only solution I can think of to reduce gas fees on most exchanges. ..I haven't found any trading sites that are doing any better, they all usually do the same thing and charge flat fees. I do know they are making a killing on gas fees when they are cheap on the chain. ..As I write this, gas fees are very expensive on chain. Today, between €6 and €10 euros. That's today. In February they were €1 or less. So keep that in mind as well.

I’d love to. I don’t know how much you already know, so please forgive me if I explain some things that you already understand. I don’t want to be patronizing...GameStop (GME) was declining in value and large hedge funds were making money with short positions, basically betting that the stock value would continue to decline. The pandemic only helped. Citadel Securities was one such hedge fund with large GME short positions...In 2021, fueled by r/wallstreetbets, GME became a “meme stock”, and retail investors were buying up shares like crazy. The price soared over 600%...These hedge funds with short positions suddenly found themselves MASSIVELY in the red. One of the risks of short-selling is that you can theoretically lose infinite money. So when GME went from $63 to $345, the hedge funds with hundreds of thousands (millions?) of short positions were losing millions of dollars every day...Hendge fund managers were fired, funds declared bankruptcy, managers and employees commit suicide. The people had spoken- and showed that WE control the markets, not THEM, and the truth was a tough pill to swallow...So, about Robinhood, the user-friendly, young-audience targeted stock trading platform. Already once fined by the SEC for manipulating trades and scraping some cash off the top of their users actions, Robinhood still became the center for this whole GME movement. A large portion of the trading going on with GME was through Robinhood...As the price continued to soar, Robinhood froze purchases for the GME stock. Users who tried to buy more GME saw an error message. There’s another whole story here, but the gist of it is the loss of influx caused fear and the price corrected quickly, saving some hedge funds from bankruptcy. Users knew it was only their strong hands and continued buying power that kept the stock up. When nobody could buy anymore people got scared and started to sell, causing an avalanche. Many users lost everything when the bubble burst...In a later investigation, it was found that the CEO of Robinhood exchanged communications with the CEO of Citadel Securities, regarding freezing trades for GME on the app. Basically, Citadel Securities asked for Robinhood to prevent users from making money, because it was costing them money… Robinhood complied...This is a clear cut case of market manipulation, and yet Robinhood and Citadel Securities got off without so much as a slap on the wrist. The case was dismissed...Robinhood is owned and operated by thieves, and they aren’t stealing from the rich and giving to the poor as their name so implies.

I'm not an expert by any means, but my 2c is that when you withdraw USDT (for example), it depends on what ecosystem your crypto is being traded on, since most projects are multichain...The best example I saw was on MEXC and it showed how much the fee would be on each chain I was able to transfer my USDT on...So at the time, it was (roughly in dollars) 1 over polygon, 6 over tron, 16 over [forgot] and 32 over ethereum.  You have to make sure your recipient address is on the same ecosystem etc... But everything is just a case of understanding how the Blockchain works...Most of these things are not illegal because these companies can just make shit up and you sign your rights away in the t&c's...In OPs case (well done them!), that is a scam since you expect when you hit "withdraw", it makes your transaction.  Blockchain technology is exactly that level of trust that we want and get, so the SEC has a stance to prove lies (to oversimplify).

Thank you I only knew of the wall Street little guys smacking the hedge funds the rbin hood part I didn't know about maybe because I'm in the UK thank you

Yes, most definitely a lot depends on the chain the USDT is on. I was only talking about the Ethereum blockchain since USDT is most prevalent there. It's also on TRON and others of course, but offering too many chains is a little much at the beginning of a project. So we're going with ETH first, then we'll slowly amp it up to others as needed...USDC announced the other day that they were exciting TRON, so not sure how that will turn out in the near future for USDT...We're going to be avoiding other chains in the initial development cycle for many reasons. We will be targeting a not so educated crypto market where people just want to solve their problem and not have to worry about it being crypto and the knowledge curve that entails. So we find it prudent to make it simple enough by just having one chain, the main one...My research was mainly geared towards reducing the gas fees as much as possible since our initial research showed that our target market did not really want to bother with that...Our withdrawal system will eventually monitor the gas price on the network and do some fancy math to try to keep the gas price to 1% of the amount being sent. This gets complicated because while doing this, we have to allow the user to decide how much they are willing to pay. So instead of a notice that says there is congestion, we can tell them the actual price and ask them if they want to pay it. There is a lot to take into account in designing this so we are spending a lot of time on it...To say it's complicated is an understatement...My whole point is that more companies within the industry should be building projects that will encourage uneducated to learn to use crypto by actually using it for regular life transactions. We are certainly working towards an attempt at doing so. Cheaper fees and gas are very, very important.
2
Oh right, I didn't associate your comment with direct relevance to your P2P exchange experience, my fault!..I absolutely agree with you in terms of "users" wanting simplicity, this is why I believe our current monetary system is flawed - corruption - this is also why I think we should educate people, I'm trying to stay away from the negative world but corporations will hit a certain $ value and "good values" disappear... The Blockchain exists so that my dumb-unknowing-ass can see behind the scenes if I want to, but also cut out the middle man in my transactions.  From your P2P perspective I couldn't begin to code all the nuances with stuff like that... Then continuously adapt when chains also update.  No thanks haha.  But, this is why there's some understanding in using math to just average your fees (as a bank for example) so that when you can transfer for $1, you benefit and cover losses by charging $7 for the transactions which are more (just example).  People corrupt the math and extort the poor as far as I'm concerned.  But alas!!  Ignore the off topic comments...This is why I was surprised when I saw MEXC show all the variants, I don't remember Binance even doing that so openly...I don't understand about USDC exciting TRON, do you mean exiting?  Personally I don't have a lot of money so I'm not spreading it around too many projects to keep up with everything, outside of HODL I just want to buy some occasional XMR for private purchases lol.

Title: Eth buy or cry later like me....

Rule of thumb...If Darknet markets accept the coin as a form of payment, it has a use case, and is worth holding onto....Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero. The holy trinity.

Money has zero to do with blockchain technology. Money is one utility for blockchain technology, and may be one of the most important ones for innovations

Always buy and you will never cry

That's why you should look at projects that are coming soon and offer strong potential, because now you won't make such a big jump on Eth. I follow the FHE branch, it will be all around us, there is an interesting Sight AI project there, and if you want decentralized nodes, you can take a look at the Rivalz Network, you can even join the testnet there.

Wow, that's some serious food for thought! It's mind-blowing to think that an investment of $100 in ETH back in 2014 could be worth over a million dollars today. 🚀..It's stories like these that make the crypto space so exciting and full of potential. Just goes to show that with the right timing and a bit of foresight, the possibilities are endless...Do you think we'll see another token with that kind of growth potential soon? What are your top picks for the next big thing in crypto? Always on the lookout for the next ETH! 🔍💸

Tokenization of Things makes no sense and if it would, its would be never be this big of value like eth marketcap. All this crypto stuff is not working in the Real World.

When I tell  people I don’t buy large cap crypto no matter how popular. I got into Shiba Inu and PEPE at Presales. Most of my tokens are at Public or private sales and sometimes at seed and preseed levels. I only invest in token with less than $200m and with a very great chance of $1B market capitalization. It’s difficult not to be in profit...If you are interested in investing in early stage cryptocurrencies and projects, you should subscribe to my newsletter: [CRYPTOFADA RESEARCH](https://cryptofada.substack.com/p/crypto-alphas-to-be-listed-on-binance)

I've had ETH in my portfolio for a long time now. I believe in its potential and now after the ETF approval, it's all about HODLing. That said, I have many other assets in my portfolio as well and I use a rypto trading bot that uses rebalancing to stay profitable and suffer minimum risks. So, my recommendation would be to diversify as much as you can and check out R100K!

> You deposited money into his exchange and he put that into his personal account...That's not quite what happened. FTX's sister company Alameda Research used FTX customer funds for risky speculative bets that they lost.

The difference between fiat and wildcat (private) currencies is the governance model and incentive structures...The central bankers - appointed by elected politicians, operating under published rules - who set the interest rates are not spruiking fiat to personally enrich themselves...Yes, they have careers and salaries and prestige and all sorts of other very human incentives. But running off to the Bahamas after pulling off a rug pull is not on the cards.

It gives the people who know it's the future more time to accumulate. These prices are extremely small fractions of what they will be.

People don't understand crypto bc they never understood what money was or is. They just treat it as a medium of exchange and keep worrying about having more of it while knowing less and less about it. If you know less and less about something that you want more and more, you have signed up for a contract that exposes your stupidity and ignorance as time goes by. Therefore, you end up with more problems even if you manage to have more money.  Most average people end up with more problems and less money or negative money, aka debt. Today, banks and governments have made sure that you have negative money and make it appear like "money." So you are in a trap, and the media and institutions don't let you know that you are in a trap..Only intelligent people have figured out they are in a trap. They know how to use the crypto to escape the matrix of the negative of money. They are doing it silently and enjoying life. They are willing to educate you. Due to hubris, most people are unwilling to admit their lack of knowledge and humiliating the minority who embrace crypto passionately.  They are still compassionate. I have not seen a crypto loving person disgracing a non-crypto holder..Time and karma will eventually play out ..You don't get bitcoin unless you deserve it..Every big innovation was adopted by society only when they deserve it. Until then, a select few are blessed with big fortunes.

The same argument can be made for fiat money. It has no inherent value, it's an unsecured ledger system wtih +800 trillion shit coins and billions more being minted every single day, the trading fees are absurdly expensive HALF of your income is forcibly taken when you earn it and then you pay 10% or more transaction fees when you spend it. ..If you think the scams in the crypto market are bad you should try trading forex for awhile. Crypto is a TAME marketplace by comparison.
3
The majority of people secretly hate themselves and don't believe they deserve good things, assume the worst, are pessimistic, etc...How many times have you heard someone say "it's a bubble"? Because people find it easier to criticize, deny, blame, let their own brain take over to make their own worst conclusions come true. Any justification to skip taking a risk and showing up to try their best in life...We call them people with no vision and they call themselves "risk averse" people. The difference between a red and a green in a DISC test...Win the game by simply showing up to play. Show them the error of their ways. With tough love and no mercy.

There are scammers in crypto a lot of them, hackers and con artist. Crypto is almost entirely a speculative market there is no intrinsic value to any non-stable coin and people will take advantage of greed. All we can do is research and not do really stupid things. We can invest in projects that will have some intrinsic or utilitarian value but if you invest in shit coins your trading bottle caps hoping someone dumber than you will buy them for a higher price or you are scamming people.
2
There is so much more than just scams in crypto. A lot of future innovation being built out as were still early in the grand scheme of things. With that being said you really do have to be careful out here thats why I trade all my crypto on a regulated exchange for extra security as there compliance ensures my crypto is safe. Been using Netcoins which i've had no issues with. Using a regulated exchange takes the stress away from being in the trenches and having my wallet drained by clicking one wrong link.
2
People need to put in the work, do the research instead of just submitting to FOMO for the hottest coin. There are some great projects out there gaining traction and solving real problems in a real way. We are really really early…there is bound to be some hiccups, and unfortunately some aholes scammers. I’m excited for the future...Edit: understood there are 1000s of coins out there and multiples of scammers. That’s why I focus on just a few coins after doing extensive research and make the best risk decisions possible. Still super speculative, so not putting my live savings in a high risk project.
2
It's frustrating to see so many people dismiss crypto as a scam. The underlying technology is sound, and blaming the entire industry for the actions of a few bad actors is unfair.
2
Couldn't have put it any better. There's bad actors everywhere, and to blame an entire industry is just crazy. Lemme give an example of a crypto that ISN'T scammy. It's called HUNDRED. Every transaction starts a 100-hour trading cooldown that locks your HUNDRED tokens in your wallet. Already, that takes care of jeets, and bots that buy and sell tokens back and forth multiple times a second. But that 100-hour cooldown is also a super-shield that protects you from anybody trying to take your crypto. If you get hacked, the hacker will be able to take every single token you have...except HUNDRED. Does that sound like a scam?
2
What's the utility of any coin? What's the return from holding any coin ?..What's stopping you creating Zavalla96 coin, that will be technically identical to btc or other coins. All the code is open source, after all. ..What we have here, is a technologically obfuscated pyramid scheme. Or pump and dump...Buy and sell for more, no fundamentals, nothing more to the entire industry than that.
2
I’m just happy I’m in a project that keeps it 💯 and fights all the problems mentioned above. Unlike all the coins that have rugged me in the past. True devs create strong community💯
2
You are confusing stocks with crypto. All crypto is a scam because we only need one ledger. Just like we only have one internet or one stock market in the 1920s we only need one blockchain so all other blockchains are indeed scams. You can make money from the scams but they are still scams.

While you argue that crypto isn’t a scam and that it suffers only from bad actors, I disagree. The industry’s lack of regulation and complexity create a breeding ground for fraud, which traditional finance systems with established protections don’t face as acutely. New investors, often lacking a full understanding of these risks, are particularly vulnerable, and this exacerbates the problem beyond just a few bad actors.

Leveraging any investment is risky. Unless you really know what you are doing, I would not try it because it can end badly.

Crypto is so much less of a scam than stocks, it isn’t even close. A unit of crypto, depending on the crypto, is an actual commodity that you can self-custody. A stock, OTOH, is an IOU voucher from your brokerage house that you own an actual unit of stock, which, even if true, is an infinitely counterfeit-able unit via naked shorting. Given that any stock can be naked shorted, ALL shares of ALL stocks are “synthetic”, which is a nicer way of saying “at least partially counterfeit.” Your only hope is that more people want to buy and hold your stock than do short it into the ground, and in this way, the “synthetic” composition is mostly legitimate ownership rather than naked short promissory notes (whose value that are often able to drive to zero, thereby confiscating the entirety of your investment).

Crypto isn't a scam however there's a distinct lack of research that goes into investments. And the cost to deploy a phony project is too low...If you're going to invest off recommendations and don't have a really thorough and proven way of doing due diligence that precedes chucking money into something then you will be scammed.

Exactly, I am not sure why people think crypto is a scam just because of losing some money, it’s about profits and losses when you come to investment. ..I am doing well with crypto also, you really need to find the right people to help you in it, those who got scammed are the minority, but when they got scammed, instead of reflecting on how they got scammed, they just make a big fuss on social media and make everyone else thinks that investments or crypto are just scams.

I always say this… there are a LOT of scams that happen IN crypto BUT crypto in itself is not a scam.

All of your comments have great points. I just want to address a few of them..."Just buy Bitcoin" BTC doesn't work everywhere. For example trying to buy a $10 lunch when the transaction fee is $15. There are some countries where $1 = 2000 of the local currency. They can't afford to use BTC on a daily basis..."All crypto is a scam" .No. Just the people who decide to use the technology to scam. There are some great cryptos out there trying to solve  actual problems. Fiat is the scam. One organization deciding how much money to print is the scam. .."What is the value of crypto".Crypto goes up when governments print money..As long as they keep printing fiat, BTC has no top.

Money just as crypto is not a scam. Humans orchestrate scams and definitely should be the scams. Crypto just needs more regulations to prevent scammers from finding it just easy

It’s a fixed supply. But we can make an infinite amount of new tokens for other coins and JPEGS too! 💩 🤡 🌍

I agree that the technology itself isn't inherently scammy. But the human element plays a huge role. People get greedy, and they make bad decisions. That's true in crypto, just like it's true in traditional finance...The problem with crypto is that the scams can be more elaborate and harder to detect. There's a lot of hype and misinformation, and it can be tough to separate the wheat from the chaff. Bitcoin and Ethereum has gained institutional interests already with big names like Black Rock involved. Some crypto projects are utilising AI in the right sense like Ocean protocol with their predictoor tool. ..With the right regulations in place, crypto could become a more stable and trustworthy asset class.

During Covid, I, like many others leaned into Crypto trading. I now understand different token purposes and the concept behind layer 1 and 2 blockchains, etc. I ain’t no expert, but I understand the basics at least...The concept of the world becoming decentralised from a financial standpoint sounds like the dream, but also a fantasy land. We are owned by billionaires and the government. If they wanted to stop Crypto tomorrow, they could make it illegal tender once it threatens central banking enough...People might still use it despite possible prosecution, but with so much resistance there, it wouldn’t be able to overthrow our global financial system anytime soon (100+ years if ever)...So, it’s sat as a “thing” that people can put their financial hopes and dreams into (fair due to its historic nature). However, it then becomes a place rife with scammers and con men...My nan ain’t gonna be making a digital wallet any time soon, because crypto is poorly suited to your average everyday person. Those that are clued up still get scammed because it’s the Wild West...It’s fair for Crypto to have the “scam” reputation to the average Joe.

I am a crypto enthusiast, and consider myself very knowledgeable. Here's the main thing people need to understand: utility DOES NOT equal *value.* ..I think the promise of blockchain is enormous. Solana and Ethereum are paving the way for how Web3 can power everything from gaming to banking. But I cannot for the life of me understand how anyone is placing any sort of numeric of even logic backed valuation of how much the tokens are worth. The only and I truly mean only crypto I understand a valuation for is Bitcoin and even that is only based on its own relative value (like gold). ..So I think we should be hesitant to use the word "scam" but virtually all of crypto is powered off hype cycle of future revenue that has yet to prove it will materialize at the magnitude of current valuations

I have 1 million in bitcoins.   I use it to pay for stuff. One year later the bitcoins doubles in value.   I regret using my 1 million in bitcoins.   They say this is the currency of the future. I struggle to see how that will be.  And that is what makes me think the crypto bubble will burst sooner rather than later

I'm glad people are thinking and talking about all this. I have been scammed in crypto more than any other single sector in life, period. I have also had higher profits with less investment or personal sacrifice, time or material, than with anything else in my life ever. Hands down..Crypto and block chain now is like the internet in the 90's. Remember? Not all of you do. There were a ton of startups, venture capital flew in and out of a largely unregulated new tech sector that was set to revolutionize every aspect of our lives. Did it ever!.Fast forward a quarter of a century, and the Internet is much more regulated, most companies failed, and the winners have become an integral part of our lives. Not everyone uses it  but most of us can't imagine life without it. .Block chain and crypto will have a similar trajectory. We are already well into said trajectory. Be careful out there, the scammers are very abundant and clever. That said, ignore or downplay the importance of crypto at your own risk. .It's not the wave of the future it's the wave of the now. Entire countries are adopting Bitcoin as their national currency. This thing is huge, and growing. .Now go buy one of my coins, $ARTX on BNB chain on pancake swap, $ARTY on Solana meme site 'pump-fun' or $FAD also a Solana meme..I PROMISE TO NEVER SCAM ANYONE. and pray I can keep that promise

Crypto IS a scam.... well 99% of it. Then again so is fiat. Bitcoin however isn't.

Dude, when those was at $.22 I was up a few hundred thousand dollars. I never invested in crypto until this bull run. It’s not even fall. We early in the market. Just hang tight there’s gonna be a lot of money put into crypto cause you can buy coins at a few cents, and have 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 bags and make a lot of money.

The technology on paper isn’t a scam, but it’s about the execution. If someone launches a new token but they own most of them or the nodes and are marketing it heavily, it’s a rug pull waiting to happen...I’ve worked in the Web3 / crypto industry and I can tell you that 95% of projects are scams. If there is no real world utility for an NFT or clever DeFi protocol, it’s a scam. If you can’t explain to a normie why doing something with a token makes sense, then it doesn’t. Also, always read whitepapers and understand the tokenomics before buying...That being said, Bitcoin is not a scam because there’s no central team behind it. The network grew organically since its inception...The bearish sentiment regarding crypto shows that most of the people in it are “invested” for pure speculation. That means it’s still in its early stages.

Bitcoin isn't a scam..Most of the altcoins and all of the memecoins are scams

“Impossible for crypto to be a scam” If you are of the mind that it is incomprehensible for it to be a scam then that’s on you.

>The code, the blockchain, they aren't inheritly scammy...Perhaps but you need people for the system to work and people ARE inherently scammers.  ..If you believe that 90% of BTC being owned by 1% of addresses isn't the same as centralization then let me introduce you to the term 'confirmation bias'.  Everyone has their own shade of lenses through which see the world and will seek out and believe information which supports their view.

The idea of btc was a noble one at start...But easy money attracts scum. And repels honest folk...So now btc is a scam. Even worse it serves the system it was supposed to topple...Eth is a scam from its inception, it never had an honest thought...Monero is on the border, much better than btc on many levels but it still attracts scum as btc. So a scam in general...Other shitcoins are pure scams...NFTs are not fucking there. Scam x10...So, in short, agreed with the op. Everything around crypto is a scam.

They say it’s scammy in the same way that people say MLMs are scammy.  The underlying concept of MLM isn’t a scam, but with very very few exceptions, every single company that implements that sales structure does scammy shit.  The underlying technology of crypto isn’t inherently scammy, but most cryptocurrencies are managed by/manipulated by/used as a currency by people who do scammy shit.  Or at least that’s the perception.

The whole fiat money system is a scam but cryptos and works much like stocks in a way which stocks is also a scam but we see liquidity as being an issue in cryptos as in stocks money flow in inflating the value and money flows out deflating the value of X asset ..I have been in and out of cryptos for a while and has taught me the basics of these instruments and how they work and in a nut shell it’s all a scam and is totally based on participation of the community and is a negative sum scenario ..This video sums it up but it’s base on stocks but cryptos have a similar type of price structure and you can substitute company performance for crypto tokenomics ..https://youtu.be/kJOWwfOQ3Sc?si=jjw9ydNY0kVQj7CH

I can assure you that BTC, ETH that whole eco-system will go to zero. it is inevitable. It's not about the story, the religion, it's simply about the technology. ..This entire space was created after Satoshi Nakamoto released the White Paper and the original protocol. BTC has been hijacked by small-blockers who don't understand how it should work. Look into Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) to really dig deeper into your due diligence.

The government doesnt print money, it borrows it from the Fed, which prints money. Also, Luna wasnt an obvious scam with its 20% at the time. ATOM had a 20% staking returns during same period and is still standing now at 14% staking returns. Not everything offering a high return is a scam, despite what this sub likes to cry. ..People thinm crypto overall is a scam because they hear it on the news. Well, let them. More bitcoin for the rest of us. We are now in the years where 1 bitcoin is no longer attainable for the average person. Everyone knew this was coming, everyone who knows about properties of sound money that is.

Not entirely. I found a project in the gaming/esports industry called GAIMIN.IO. The business model and project are quite extensive, involving CPU/GPU monetization and machine learning, which bridges nodes for AI jobs. They use Esports/PC gamers' PCs when they are not in use. It’s legit. They also own a globally known esports organization. Called the Gladiators or Gaimin Gladiators..The project is still in beta development, but I wanted to note that while there is stigma around crypto/blockchain, there are truly developing projects that utilize this technology. The ticker is $GMRX if you want to do your own research. It’s quite interesting. Just wanted to share that as there are still true projects that have potential and can use tokenomics and general blockchain tech in realworld scenario..

Bro, crypto is full of scams...Not even talking about tokens, but legit coins with blockchain. I won't name them here but many "legit" coins had a premine which is a obvious scam that's not so obvious. Could go on and on... Pick wisely what you invest in

I agree with a lot of your comments about crypto technology. The problem comes 1) from how “funding” works for the space— and how it is not driven by value or any other tangible metrics. 2) memes & shitcoins..1- There are very few tokens or crypto projects making revenue or focused on building value. Token price are generally driven by speculation and hype only. ..2- Shitcoins and memes prove that the space isn’t serious yet. These are only Ponzi by design. Not saying that it isn’t fun but that contributes to the image. ..I’m very supportive of the space — and work at a crypto project. I do think it’s still early days and has the opportunity to evolve into a more legit space. However, there are opposing forces that only want a “repeatable casino.”

not everything, just crypto is a Scam.

This is the problem. Blockchain could have been *better* designed for thieves. We're slowly figuring out which guardrails we need, but you only need to look at how many "currencies" exist to realize the space is still mostly scams, junk bonds, money laundering, etc...But it's getting better!

But crucially and critically it isn’t actually anonymous unless you’ve put it through a mixer or are using a privacy coin. It might take work but you can literally in real time follow along and watch as bad actors do the shit they do. Unlike the traditional financial system where everything happens in shady backrooms, uses cash, and is webs of legal entities you can’t find information on. People might still feel helpless looking at either form (and you might notice they do and will keep giving money to the same scammers) but it doesn’t seem that crypto is a system that has more bad actors than the regular financial systems. An actual study on per capita bad actors would be fascinating though.

That logic doesn't work for blockchains. Each block chain has different  tradeoffs e.g scalabily, security and decentralization. It's difficult to achieve all 3 in one blockchain. This is why more than one is necessary for now. ...That being said, we definitely don't need the number of blockchains that currently exist.

Why?

So when your coal mining town in West Virginia goes bust and the county folds, you don't see any value of your property deeds being stored in the form of an NFT on a ledger that exists in your town, outside your town, state, and country?  That's a pretty easy sell for me on NFT's and blockchains.  Plenty of poorly ran towns have record keeping issues and I see this as a progressive technology that solves a problem.

You have to ask why is it that there is a lack of regulation ? US government has had opportunity but has provided little. ..Many crypto projects have asked for clear rules and regulations instead the SEC just sues projects for violating the rules that you should have known about but we won’t actually tell you what they are.

Hard to feel sad for people that invest their entire life savings on some meme coins or coins that scream I am a rug pull then feel bad about them. There are crazy amounts of companies on stock market that goes bankrupt every day or never recover and it's your responsibility to invest your money to more established projects specially if its an amount that would effect your life. Regulation is needed of course so scammers get jail time but it wouldnt stop people losing their life savings.

Throwing the baby out with the bath water here. BTC is most certainly not a scam. Still represents a noble idea and technological breakthrough in money. Not going anywhere anytime soon.

I believe BTC is being gobbled up by these ETF mainly blackfoock who has legislation now stating it's too big to fail but also puts it into a position that the gov can lock it down.  Once it aquires so much gov will take over black rock and control that amount of BTC and peoples investments .  Xrp will probably usher in seeing as they seem to be dropping panties for every gov in the world and it will probably skyrocket and the stable coin will be used as currency but that makes it as bad as a cbdc every gov has been trying to do  or act like they have because they knew they already had xrp intertwined in everything .  XMR is the best in my eyes just need a smarter easier way of transacting it to make it more of a use

The same argument can be made for fiat money.  Dollars have zero inherent value either yet the law of supply and demand makes them valuable because people want them.

1. The government prints money. The government elects the Fed who fulfills the policies they want. If the Fed doesn't do what the government wants they get replaced. ..2. Luna was the most obvious scam I've ever seen. ..3. Atom does not have returns. Atom has inflation. You're not making any money with Atom. You're just getting more of it. But the value of what you put in is down by a lot I'm guessing. Inflation will always devalue. Just look at the dollar. Plus nobody is building anything on Atom.

I pay to businesses in crypto daily and also accept payments in crypto.  I also have a monera marketplace .  A bunch of it out there are complete scams and made to profit on the front and run before the pull.  Otherwise I look at any currency regulated by a central bank as being a scam slow pull that's been going on for centuries , it's the original scam of all times unless it was gold coins.  Crypto at least has a definite supply that a gov can't just turn on the printer.  The system is there for your taxes and ironically there was no tax in the US before the central bank, it ran off selling bonds and tariffs on goods coming into the country.  A flat sales tax and tarrifs and we could abolish the IRS and another 3/4 of the federal gov but we would also have to stay in our own lane and out of the rest of the worlds business fortify our country and build our own products with our own resources . We are actually on our way of accomplishing that and if we can get globalist out of the federal gov will accomplish it .

Well,  the crypto is just an investment into a software company in most cases.

I think once people accept that 99% of crypto use cases will have nothing to do with being/replacing a currency, we will be better off. Lots of people out there hear that there are 1000s of cryptos and think "we already have cash, and who the hell wants 1000s if different currencies." I've experienced this push back so many times...People need to look at crypto as little software and process control/validation tools, and ignore the "currency" part of the name...If we are lucky there will be 1-2 currencies that come from all of this, the rest is just productivity, verification, and process control software.

I recently helped a friend build a telegram community for a token launch (he decided after a month he didnt want to continue and shelved the project...he hated telegram)...Crypto marketers are like 'Give me a grand for one ad on my telegram channel, operated in an anonymous name, with 500,000 users that may as well be bots, and you need to pay me 100% in advance'.   ..Forget launching tokens, trading or staking, open a telegram group, fill it with bots talking to each other and send your bots to join the channel of your advertisers...That is (i am fairly sure) what 50% of those groups and channels are doing.

Based on your argument, then AI technology is a scam , telecommunications is a scam, even fiat currency is a scam.

Not. Even. Close.  The average entrant has neither enough time nor [inside] knowledge to scour the internet for just the right bit of information that allows them to make the savviest crypto investment.  Whereas the same effort on publicly traded companies would yield enough information to make a reasonably sound decision, but there's always the professional to fall back on.

No but I did have a Mt Gox account before it went under. If they hadn't been manipulating the price bitcoins would never have been as big as they are today. Every crypto exchange that gets shut down is like a massive token burn it makes ALL of the other coins in circulation more rare and therefore more valuable according to the law of supply and demand.

You do realize usdt or other stable coins exist right?  And the only dealer around me is my used auto dealer license and yeah I'll accept XMR .  My dismantling business does also.  XMR isn't a stable but it's fluctuation is not massive .  Even the craziest day of volatility with BTC is not halving or doubling in value .  Most that accept crypto has there specific coins they take and to avoid the volatility will swap some to stable coins for overhead and the rest leave investment etc.  the statement you made above I guess shows the amount of knowledge you have on the subject tho and that's not a jab of any sort .  I'm probably older than most that have done research and figured out how I would like to accept it because if you like it or not it's getting adopted more and more every day and the trust in any central currency is being lost along with the govs that back it.  No currency survives, inflation eventually gets them all .  Thousands of years of history shows the same story.  Me personally I'd rather have my funds in a currency that can be private , can't be controlled by a gov, can't be printed into toilet paper, and banks can't control how it's deposited or spent.  You say criminal acts probably , I say the largest criminal organizations on earth are central banks and there yard dogs are govs .  More than likely Geneva in general and Schwab controls those entities also.im a you do you type of guy and will never down you if you don't believe the same as me and no I don't keep all my eggs in one basket.

You're talking about your personal experience. There are millions of people who have a totally different experience with banks.

Just because many people are using crypto as a means to orchestrate a scam doesn’t make that product a scam per se. For people who doesn’t wish to get into bitcoin due to regulatory concerns, then just don’t get into it . There’s no one pointing a gun at u to own or buy bitcoin. It is simply digital money in its purest form, bitcoin itself can’t dictate anyone using it to do good or bad activities. ..If anyone has to fall for some stupid scams associated with bitcoin , then it is on them for the lack of due diligence and negligence. ..Regulation or lack of regulation doesn’t change its properties. In fact it is designed to be free from authoritative manipulation. Likewise for examples I quoted , if anyone think social media are full of scams , then susceptible individuals should just stay away .

You can easily show crypto on taxes , in fact even traders who only use it for investments are having to file on every transaction like the stock market , I don't agree with it and welcome a nice revelutionary war not just for taxation but just a general corruption that our gov has been taken over by the last 60 years or so.

I'm on the shitter typing Id really need to care past taking a dump to go and find links to all the businesses that accept it but I did reply chase bank accepts payments in xrp in a separate statement .

I really don't need validation from someone who is just here to talk about something they clearly don't have full knowledge of to back up there opinions , that's shown by trying to insult me .  The only way one is ever insulted is if they care about the opinion of the one making the statements.

Ha Banks like to say it’s for customer protection . It’s just lame and hypocritical, I very much doubt it because I heard many stories of innocent people exited from the bank because of doing transactions that bank don’t approve of . If they are indeed for customer protection, why would they want to do this to users . Fact is they just want total control of how users manage their own finances and dictate how people choose to use their own money...FI expects all users to declare to them how people use their own hard earned money, what they spend on, and for what purpose . Yet they offer no explanation at all when they decide to exit u. They should learn to treat fellow mankind who are co-habitats on earth as humans

Bitcoin is exactly created to be free from corrupted governments who are very keen to “regulate” it and turn it into a fiat system. The makings of a CBDC is proof of that. No offence to any 70 year old who chose to put money into some silly scam and end up getting scammed . Stupidity isn’t confined geographically and demographically, if u don’t know what u are doing , then just stay away from it . No need for dictators to over regulate it in the name of AML/CFT bullshit ...Not that I am in approval of what SBF is doing , isn’t he simply just applying the fiat system concept I.e rehypothecation into his business model . The only difference is bank can have bail-in from depositors funds and bail-out by tax payers monies . The monetary system is unfair and let’s not pretend it is . If regulated fiat system can enjoy such benefits, whereas crypto doesn’t . What right does government have to regulate it ?

Ftx is just a typical financial fraud non exclusive to crypto and Celsius Alex macshinsky is just another con artist . People have the rights to buy bitcoin and storing it away in their hardware wallet in their own custody without the need for any intermediary.   Putting crypto into Celsius staking is akin to putting fiat currency into traditional Ponzi scheme that still very much exists . It all boils down to every individual doing their own due diligence for scam prevention. If one chose to be negligent, nobody can help them. ..Where there’s money to be made , there will be bad actors regardless of traditional financial or any type of investment instruments. I don’t see the need to conflate things in a way that categorise crypto as a haven for scams. 1 btc=1 btc , whether u chose to put it safely in a self custody hardware wallet , leave it on a shady exchange or to stake it on a unregulated DeFi space . The choice is yours to take . If u are looking for a nanny , then crypto ain’t for u. ..Bitcoin is people’s money , it stands for freedom . The world is so big with different jurisdictions and some banning it , some accepting it as legal tender . No one should be given arbitrary rights to control and regulate it . Using AML/CFT, scam as an excuse to try to regulate it is a good try, but no thanks . It’s exactly designed to give power back to people who have been oppressed.

Title: Mark Cuban: Harris Likely More Open to Crypto Than Biden
181
I'll hear her out, but the administration has cuffed the crypto market for almost the entire term until they found out it was an issue with the voters.
21
Hey, maybe she'll buy some.  It couldn't hurt.
3
Why are we hearing this opinion for the first time, 3 months away from the election. I don’t buy it. She was also a part of the administration trying to dismantle it. The whole unrealized capital gains tax turned me off of anyone associated with this administration
13
As president, Trump declared bitcoin “not money” and criticized it as “highly volatile and based on thin air.” He cautioned that crypto assets helped facilitate illegal underground markets...“We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever,” Trump wrote on Twitter in 2019. “It is called the United States Dollar!”
2
For sure another stunt, but let's wait for some of its changes
3
She’s probably more open to email and PowerPoint as well.

Give them people their games!!

Kamala "Bitcoin is money for criminals" Harris, open to crypto?..And the only two names I've heard for SEC heads in a Kamala administration have been re-hiring Gensler or Elizabeth Warren, both anti-crypto, Warren, especially...Anything positive related to Kamala and crypto is entirely electioneering. If she actually got elected she'd do everything in her power to kill crypto...Always tons of anti-Trump bots in this sub anytime politics is brought up. Supporting democrats and Bitcoin is itself a conflict of interest.
1
Didn't she call BTC "criminal money"? To be fair I read that on Twitter so the source probably isn't reliable.
1
She opens for anything that advances her lust for power

But not selected by the people to be nominated instead inserted by elites? Ok bots

RFK will be the best for crypto. He talks about adding BTC to treasury,  he knows much more about BTC

I mean, their whole job is to consider things that are issues with voters. Government moves slow and cautiously unless reacting to emergencies.

Her party is against crypto and super pro big banks. Republicans aren't going to be much better, but they'll at least leave crypto alone.
4
Yeah, I’m not believing her. Much of her party is all about financial control and monitoring.

It’s not an issue with voters lol. You’re living in a bubble.  She’s just for freedom and isn’t going to restrict you from investing in any dumb shit you want to invest your money in.

Were you quoting Kamala?

Too bad he’s nuts
6
I’m sick of hearing excuses and people rationalize and defend the democrats. They’ve been in power 12 of last 16 years. What have they done for the American people? Trump did more in his 4 years than Obama and Biden combined. They say whatever sounds good at the time - let’s not forget defund the police, mandatory vaccinations, Ukraine war, crypto is for criminals, border-wall is racist  etc etc
-1
You think they’re going to leave it alone simply because  you like one party more then the other. Neither are for crypto, both parties has made it clear. It’s all just a race for the crypto bros votes.

No, dude, its terrible if you own a home or invest. Imagine having to pay a capital gains tax every year on your homes appreciation, you don’t make money when it comes time to sell. Same with investments, it’s possible you have to sell just to pay for the capital gains tax. Surely you can’t be that dense

The democrats tried to kill the industry. Or are you forgetting that they've been suing everyone and they even tried to debank the entire industry?

It’s a progressive tax. It doesn’t apply to everyone. The proposed minimum is much lower than $1 billion, though, I’ll give you that...If you have over $100 million in assets, then I understand why you might be upset. If you don’t, the proposed plan won’t apply to you.

Slavery. No way to build wealth to escape the system.

Really, I'm not a fan of the wealth tax concept, but we need to increase taxes, and we need to target the top %...I'd rather just dramatically increase estate taxes over a certain amount to help reduce the dynasties of wealthy trust fund kids.
1
Nahhhh they undervalued Mar-a-lago so I’m sure they’ll assess your properties fairly…. Surely
1
And perhaps you aren't aware but the Democrat delegates are free to appoint their nominee all the way until the convention. Which hasn't happened yet. So you're wrong...And aren't conservatives the ones always saying we live in a Republic, not a democracy? Only when it's convenient?
1
but thats the thing. Kamala Harris as the VP was literally selected by the people when they voted for Biden in 2020 and the 2024 primaries.

Did more for the wealthy and massive corporations

Again, your demonizing one party when the entire gov as a whole never wanted to legitimatize crypto in the first place. They see that it’s inevitable and both parties are quickly trying to pivot back on aggressive behavior towards crypto. But yes keep screaming democrats are the bad guys, we get it your voting for trump this year, who gives a shit.
2
Seems unfair. I don’t typically like things that are unfair. Whether they affect me or not...EDIT: also, I don’t mean to sound like a TikTok bro, but I strive to make as much money as I can. Maybe I get to 100M, maybe I don’t. But I’ll at least have the attitude that it’s a possibility
-4
I’ll say this: you’re not where you want to be because some billionaire isn’t paying taxes. Most of us, even the ones that despise these billionaires, support them…. Every. Single. Day. Buy something off Amazon? Thank Bezos. Did you shop at Walmart? Thank the Waltons. Still using Windows? Thank Billy. Play Blizzard games? Buy games off Steam? Eat a Mr. Beast chocolate bar? (Me either). The point is, they created something, and it’s so good we can’t get away from it. That should be rewarded with an impactful amount of money that represents how much it impacts our world. The argument against it, well I just hear a cry baby that’s not gracefully accepting they’ll never amount to that level of incredible-ness. Nike sucks, I’ll agree. That child labor shit sucks

Title: Unpopular Opinion. ADA & XRP are trash. Stop buying it.
164
Not vey unpopular but also a bit biased since this logic can be applied to so many coins
107
Weird way of saying that you bought ADA on their ath
27
By that logic we should have abandoned the internet after the dotcom bubble.
106
Cardano’s tech is a lot nicer than ETH tbh. Smoother, faster transactions with a lot less in fees. Also, Cardano no longer a ghost chain and its TVL has been climbing steadily. ADA will see its day in the sun and a lot of people will be caught in the Dust
118
[effacé]
51
Weird thing to say about ADA. Clearly there is a media blackout on Cardano so most people are unaware of how decentralised, secure and scalable it has become...If anything a real trader would be looking for value not already priced in and buying to position for the future.
55
I only use XRP to transfer between CEX without fees, 100% uptime unlike other centralized blockchains.
16
Yaaaaawn... Get a fucking real opinion. Jesus fucking christ. No one cares. Everyone I know using Cardano is very happy with it.  .If you think it's junk you've clrearly never spent time using it. 🙄
18
Why would you ever put ada and xrp in the same basket though....ADA has a huge future ahead. XRP, not so much....Science, baby.
38
FUD
6
Tech wise cardano is solid, personally never had an issue. Horrendous take tbh.
5
Well the difference between those 2 is ADA has a future. The performance atm isn't that great because they're slow in development (perfectionists). While XRP had its best days already. Opponents like XLM are better and there is no point in using XRP.
16
Did you know it’s been battling a lawsuit for the last 4 years or have you been living under a rock? Of course the price has been suppressed.

I can do more with my ADA than btc. Without ada I would've never bought 17k BTC and still had my ada being staked and was able to get btc from my awards.  Your stupid OP sorry. Stop being a trabalism fake btc maxipad....Edit Op is a solana holder says it all. I'm fucking glad I choose "rich" and sold all my solana for btc, ada, and world mobile and alephium. Thanks op for this stupid post. Hopefully you'll be selling your solana at 50$ soon.

I think both are too high cap and too old to be worth a long term bet now. Their major narrative periods have passed. Whether just holding or actively using DeFi/web3 stuff, better off where I believe there's a lot more potential for airdrops from newly tokenized projects/games. Right now I focus on Ronin but going to be taking a deeper look at Sei and Sui ecosystems. Ronin isn't really new but I see a good amount of games on it and a steady stream of games being announced with major financial backing. ..Then eventually move on to new chains if those start seeing declines of new projects after the backing chain devs start running out of funds to attract projects

Agreed

I thought this was the consensus

Are you new to crypto? It doesn’t matter if the product or the company or the project is trash. It matters if it rises when BTC rises...Elevate your understanding of how this whole thing works. This is about making money. Not about masturbating to the best business plan...Those days may be coming in the future but they’re not here yet. Right now, it’s about riding the wave every four years and cashing out. Rinse and repeat...No room, no time, and no interest in project specific drama...Source: have been investing in crypto since 2012.

I consider that true opportunity is in ADA native tokens like: Minswap, Iagon, Agix, Meld, WMT, Snek, etc... Cardano was able to stack 94B MC without having any particular utility in it's blockchain during last bullrun. Obviously, everyone has their own reasons for not investing in a particular asset but my perspective is that price will go up as the market gains momentum. ..Not financial advice.

I was early to ADA, did well on it, and swapped for Bitcoin. I don’t knock Cardano, but time has shown me I made the right call.

Unfortunately I have big bags of both ADA and XRP, I do believe in XRP long term but I think I’m going to get out and just keep 1000 of each and taking my profits and getting into SEI or SUI two that I’ve been hearing a lot of good things about but haven’t been able to get into because I’ve been waiting for XRP and ADA to move.

Chill kids, grab a juice box or something. This looks like a peepee measuring contest and half of you dont even have a ruler geez obviously a big fat post of fanboyism and bs sprinkled with bind fanboy vibes for either coin. Just cause you dont like a coin doesnt make it shit. And not actually reading about a coin before poating anything is as dumb as it gets . Reddit is not a source, binance squre is not a source, yourube is not a source. Learn to read the whitepapers, the roadmaps and watch the data and utility of a coin before splattering poopoo out.

ADA is so isolated from most other crypto and XRP could have been good but the SEC steps in to screw that up. They could be good in the future but I'm not buying this bull run.

Facts

Let's be honest. BTC is king. Apart from bitcoin the next important thing in crypto is stablecoins. ..  .I own only ethereum but ETH has proven to be vaporware. It's profitable. I stake 24 validators. But it doesn't mean it's useful. ..  .Anything other than that is useless crypto that doesnt have a reason to exist. If the argument is that it exists because people buy it, Dogecoin is top 8 and shiba inu is top 11 at this point. Coins that are a parody of crypto at near the top. ..  .But to each their own. If people buy shitcoins that s not my problem.

I agree OP. ..So long as someone like Charles is at the helm, big money will always snub something like ADA. Charles split from the other founders of Ethereum because he was all about the money and juicing the crowd to get it. They say "Don't trust, verify" and Charles is a verified rugger...EDIT: He's pretending to be working on ADA still to avoid jail time.

BTSE is a fantastic exchange for beginners. The platform is easy to navigate, and their customer support team is incredibly helpful. As someone new to crypto trading, I felt comfortable diving in and learning the ropes with BTSE. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get started in the world of cryptocurrency...
1
Frankly, ADA is the most advanced technology. While ETH uses its 'first-comer' status in the smart contract segment and popularity, I see, soon or later, ADA rising and capturing a significant portion of the smart-contract market share. ..Just examine their rock-solid development roadmap, and you will understand what it means to create something stable and safe for the future. Yes, they could focus on marketing a bit more, but you know what? ADA's team doesn't care about popularity—they focus on long-term functionalities that cover all possible use cases. This is the nature of scientists. I will hold my ADA and plan to sell it at some point when I retire.

📞This wise guy on reddit told us to buy ada and xrp bro’s before it’s too late☎️

XRP and ADA are trash. .Listen to news and watch numbers..False narratives and sh* performance of both coins..Very genius marketing and pathetic technology and project advancements..All the retail backers are just pumping for a massive and very skilled XRP team manipulation of numbers, to strip people of realistic gains..Look at the tokenomics of performance in the last five years, it’s utterly trash.

I had a client come in for an appointment about 2 years ago with an XRP hat and Shirt on giddy as can be….He proceeded to try and tell/sell ME on how amazing it was and it is getting close to being more popular than BTC blah blah….The price If I remember correctly was like .86.  After he left and didn’t buy the product that HE inquired about and the whole reason he even came in….I shorted XRP and made more than double the commission I would have made off him 🤡

The fastest transaction I’ve ever seen in ADA was yesterday when I swapped 75% of my ADA bag for ICP.

What dApps have been built on Cardano aside from swaps same for XRP? .Low fee narrative isn’t going to work for people who know there’s other native coins that offer fast transactions on platforms that have actual applications being built. .P2P use case is dying out and the majority of that market share belongs to doge and shib so good luck 👍

Both fanbases exist in a bubble. XRP in the CBDC is going to for some reason use Ripple rather than anything homegrown. I don't know what is supposed to drive users to XRP in ways it hasn't done in the last 10 years. It's existence and price is just inertia at this point. Sometimes I still see people tout 2017 feats like it's fast and use it for exchange transfers - same with XLM bag holders - (waste of money, transfer what you already have or use USDT since almost  every exchange uses USDT trading pairs)..Cardano those that got hit with Hoskinson used car salesman talk. For a smart contract chain, Cardano only stands out in send/receive speeds and fees against base Ethereum. It competes with base base Ethereum on throughput as in they're both pretty damn slow. Network fees are around 10 to 20 cents with current network activity. DApp fees get worse with DEXs that charge 2 ADA batcher fees. Not ridiculous but still more expensive than many other lvl1 chains and ETH lvl 2 chains. Cardano itself has already experienced congestion issues multiple times in the past. Transactions eventually complete but the congestion issues with so little activity makes it not fast in my opinion. Fees at current levels of 10-20 cents is not low against todays competition. I've seen nothing to suggest its transaction finality is competitive with todays competition

Tech is good but untested for chaos. What is mean is it has not be tested for scalability, attacks , congestions, etc etc as it never has enough volume. Eth has been tested on multiple parameters. It has traction, volume and high daily users app which cardano does not, it is lonely out there - not to say it is inferior tech, it is not - it is just untested. .Developers are not building on it and ushers are not using it much. .For ada to succeed it has to have marketing, volume and traffic - just good tech won’t do in the real world. Tech is one piece. .I think I will be selling this bull run and may not come back to ADA unless something substantially  changes

What advantage does ADA have over ETH or SOL or any L2s for that matter? It processes fewer txs than SOL. It’s less decentralised than ETH. It doesn’t have the developer ecosystem that eth + l2 does.

It's one of the most shilled coins of the past decade. How is there a media blackout?

Scalable? They launched smart contracts after 6 years of building with a pathetic .86 max, real-world, smart contract transaction per second limit. It's 2.5 years later and most transactions are still done using those limitations. The network currently is unusable for any type of real smart contract volume, when there is volatility it can take hours to get a transaction through.... Sure, they are building! But they are some of the slowest builders around, and everyone else is building too. Every day they fall further behind, with a product that was obsolete by the time it was launched....There is no blackout. Cardano now is the same thing as 2 years ago or of 6, it's not useable and the message is they are building something and you should wait until it's ready.  The public is bored of that message though, and it is less compelling every day that passes.

Bro, he helped make ETH and ADA and has a Blackhawk to top it off. Idk what you consider successful, but in my books, he's made it. I personally can't stand him, but I back ADA because of its tech, and he has no say in ADA anymore.

There's another one even earlier, like 90's stating the same. ..(or maybe we are talking the same one lol)..Seems kinda like how people tend to be like "things were better when I was young/teen/etc etc, even though when you think about it objectively that's a bit of a stretch imo regardless of what generation you are...If I recall, humans have a tendency to do this because we naturally tend to remember 'bad' things as more impactful and while good things aren't unimportant, they don't stick out in our memory quite like bad things do...Like yeah I have a lot of nostalgia about the 90's but also it was kinda shit (objectively). Give me the option of streaming my shows on demand vs waiting for x time, or high-speed v dial-up any day over the 90's...90's me: what do you mean you can have every book you own accessible in a tiny square electronic device? What witchcraft is this you weirdo?..A 70 inch TV that ISNT a 100-pound ugly monstrosity and can be easily lifted by two people? What???

Solana outpreforms ADA solely because it's getting so many liquidity through buying sol for scam coins. Basically at this point it should be named RUG (rugpull coin) because it's so easy to create scam token compared to other chains. This by all means if you believe in crypto technology is contradictory because there won't be new people believing in the idea and your scam coins will become worthless. You're mentioning market sentiment in some other comment if I'm not mistaken and currently it is based towards scamming new people (buying sol to buy other rugpull coins) comming into the crypto space. I could not agree with you more since I see what is happening on Solana...I can compare it to the fidget spinner era where you could buy them for a year or two in every possible store. We sell shoes but you can also get some spinner to put on your laces. The people realized it is not helping with their stress (as it was marketed) and was all a big fat marketing scam. In the early 90s the internet was luckaly built by the scientists. It was purpously built on the idea of sharing knowledge and to be accessible from any device and was supported by strong community of smart people trying to achieve a common goal. This community grew over time and people started to realize that after all it is a good idea indeed. They built a strong pillars to be supported even if some mayor issue occurs. But still after 30 years this idea is being slowly and continously developed but the fidget spinner era is over...I don't mind you playing with your fidget spinner, but please don't cry here if it breaks. Also, I agree with your saying that we should stop buying ADA because we probably bought it enough for a lifetime and will be really valuable in 30y time. We can leave a bit for others that will adopt it later when they realize that the Lamborgini could have not be built with some low level materials but you need scientists to do it propely. Average joe can build you 1:43 toy or fidget spinner but have it your way and listen to what marketing gurus with an intention to screw you over are whispering to your ear.

If you think so 🤷‍♂️ they explain everything, let the community vote for every critical decision, proof everything important mathematically, coorperate with multiple universities to continue scientific develpoment and now set up a whole new foundation for builders and devs...They definitly do stuff, it's often just not stuff that instantly pulls investors like untrue blackrock investing in hedera news did. That just pulls short lived hypes.....I'm not a cardano maxi but I think it is one of the projects that will succeed long term...

You mean those gains that were all given back? Also news flash those gains aren’t even impressive anymore. If you touched anything ordinal related you’re sitting on 1000X gains. I pulled a few 2500X myself and the bull market is just getting started. ..Neither of those coins will ever do more than a 10X. You failed the test.

He is the type of person that is missing killer instinct. I think that being professor in high school would suit him best. He’s not likable, successful people wouldn’t do anything with him. .That said, he might be billionaire, thanks to specifics of crypto business. Look at meme coins, it’s not hard to sell illusion to the public..My point is, that he doesn’t possess skills to finish Cardano project and therefore I wouldn’t hold ADA.

Crypto is all about Narrative. If there is no narrative then price will reflect that. The only reason ADA isn’t going to zero is because 0 is impossible. Send it to .01 cent 🤝

Gitbub comments, the most vaunted of Cardano's performance metrics! Also, the dumbest way to measure progress for software....It's run by a guy with almost no GitHub activity, who has half a degree from a community college.

Ada has to do more than a 6x to reach its previous all time highs. I would be surprised if it gets over 1.20 again. The only crypto that you can fairly safely “look down the road on” is bitcoin. Aside from that, older coins get replaced by newer coins with better technology.

What is your opportunity cost between holding ADA & buying a new and shiny out performer with a narrative? ..Think about it. ..NGMI.

You could ask those questions about most crypto projects and the average holder wouldn't know the answer.

When Bitcoin broke those ETF highs in February, most altcoins got left behind. Bitcoin did a 2x from the jan lows, most alts did less and then broke their January lows just recently on the WW3 narrative.

What a load of BS. If you’re up 2500x what the fuck are you doing on reddit bro 😂😂..Also these ordinals that did 1000x - do they not crash 99.999% afterwards?..A 10x more than satisfies me, of course a crypto degen may want more…

you didn’t address my argument. If you send $100 of bitcoin to someone, you will probably lose $10 in fees and have to wait 1 hour. This is a serious problem. Do you have any counter-arguments to this?

I talked to god and he told me to do a good deed today & so I made this post😂 people don’t gotta listen let them get rekt

Tbh I'm not sure. I was a big fan of ADA and I did get caught up in FOMO last bullrun although I did start buying at below 40c, I just didn't sell when I should have. Learnt my lesson there!..But I always like the idea of doing something with perfection and security in mind. Slow amd steady etc but the last year, I've realised that that's not what the world cared about. They want big flashy things and constant movement. I don't necessarily disagree with that and there's a reason that the bug tech companies constantly pivot and build, break, repeat and its cos you have to follow the market and be prepared to change course. Cardano doesn't appear to do that a such and that's why I think the average person gets bored and hates on them. ..Not giving an opinion on whether that's right or wrong but their approach is definitely something that won't get sudden price surges, and if that's what you're in it for, I think you'll suffer. I know I'm regretting it a bit...It doesn't matter what you are doing, but what you're seen to be doing. Perception is everything.

Friend, you’re putting Ada and xrp in the same category, made a post that men can cheat but women can’t, and your time horizon why Ada sucks is in the past 3 years while we’ve been in a bear market while mentioning nothing about its tech ..It’s ok to not have an opinion on something you’re clearly new to
16
Evidently no answer to your question about cardano will satiate your scepticism. ..Perhaps if you’re not willing to dyor, and relying on reddits general responses to point you in the right direction instead of being spoon fed, this may not be the right project for you:) maybe solana is your best bet, I’m sure you’ll find plenty of answers to your questions behind their meme coin community, downtime, VC funding etc.

So your argument against Cardano is that you could make more short-term profit in SHIB or BONK or something? Lol ok

But if there is an upgrade to Ethereum it's covered everywhere for months, even Bitcoins non upgrades get excess coverage...If people don't even know the upgrades I don't see how it could be one of the most shilled.

We are covering the accusation of it being one of the most shilled.  If it was everyone would know the answer, like we all have Bitcoin and Ethereum "news" covered every which way to Sunday

Dude thinks Cardano doesn't have working smart contracts, that's some vintage FUD right there. And some TPS FUD too, really bringing out the oldies.

What about coti ?

Correct because UTXO does NOT work natively with Smart Contracts. One would need a conversion layer which will make the resulting product inferior in every way in comparison to something that uses Merkle tree for example.

Would love to make a bet with you on that one, I am pretty convinced (like 95% as of now) ADA will have a new ATH until end of 2025, if not 2026 the latest..Is there a way to lock this bet in digitally? That would be sick.

You jelly? You’ll be lucky to get 10X. You don’t know how to play the game fren. You never hold any altcoin for more than one cycle. You always buy new shit, with the only exception to that rule being Bitcoin.

I’m a professional trader friend. Been in the game for 6 years & have been around for 2 full cycles. I’m already rich off Crypto. ..No one cares about tech. ..People want to make money. ..Only a few projects are doing well because of their tech. ..ADA isn’t one of them.

What’s the relevancy of his post that men can cheat and women can’t to this overall discussion? I was with you until you said that.

You said "look at their GitHub", I retorted about r/cardano's fascination with commit amounts, and you continue with "Evidently no answer to your question about cardano will satiate your scepticism."........Cardano's had downtime too! They just bury the evidence and the community is too fanboish to confront it head on!

That's because ETH is relevant. ADA isn't. That's not a "media blackout." That's because the news follows things people give a shit about.
